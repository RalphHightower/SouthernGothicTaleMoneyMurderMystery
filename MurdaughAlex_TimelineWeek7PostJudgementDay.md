|The ‘Front Porch of the Lowcountry’ handles ‘Murdaughpalooza’ with aplomb …|
|Prior to the commencement of the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ main event in Walterboro, South Carolina back in January, I was already defending this city from its vocal (fry) haters.|
|Today? I’d absolutely take a bullet for its residents, who handled the recent ‘Murdaughpalooza’ circus with absolute aplomb – earning the love and loyalty of the entire nation in the process.|
|The ‘Front Porch of the Lowcountry’ – known for its signature red rocking chairs – rolled out the red carpet for those attending the double homicide trial of accused killer Alex Murdaugh beginning on January 23. Presented with the mother of all logistical nightmares (an O.J. Simpson-sized trial in a city several thousand times smaller than Los Angeles), court, county and city officials planned exhaustively and meticulously, implemented skillfully and consistently and improvised adeptly and adroitly.|
|The result of all that hard work? Justice.|
|Walterboro and its surrounding jurisdictions saw the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century’ through to the very end … enduring long hours, surmounting unforeseen challenges (see here and here) and performing their jobs under the most intense pressure and scalding hot spotlight imaginable.|
|At every step, this community and its people displayed a grace, goodness, humility and helpfulness that showcased for the nation – and the world – what true southern hospitality is all about.|
|It wasn’t just the command performance given by Colleton County clerk of court Becky Hill and her staff – whose exemplary administration of this trial drew rave reviews from judge Clifton Newman, from attorneys for both sides and from members of the media. Nor was it only Colleton County sheriff Buddy Hill – whose men and women distinguished themselves as witnesses inside the courthouse and as protectors of the circus enveloping it. Nor was it just Scott Grooms – Walterboro’s newly installed tourism director whose seemingly omnipresent helpfulness made everyone’s lives easier on countless occasions.|
|No, this was truly a community effort – one involving hundreds of people who decided individually and collectively to go above and beyond and work together in pursuit of a purpose larger than themselves. All while doing so in a spirit of servanthood that uplifted everyone around them throughout the six-week duration of these proceedings.|
|From the beginning, Walterboro and its people set the tone for these proceedings with their hard work, hospitality and cheerfulness. That uplifting example wasn’t just confined to the deputies, bailiffs and constables at the courthouse, either. It extended from mayor Bill Young and his team to the servers at local bars and restaurants like the [Barrel House Grille](https://www.facebook.com/barrelhousegrille104/) or [Castillo’s Pizzeria](https://www.castillospizzeria.com/) – and to local retail establishments like Twig or the [Artists’ Hub of the ACE Basin](https://www.facebook.com/people/Artists-Hub-of-the-ACE-Basin-AHABs/100063695636818/) (a.k.a. [AHAB](https://www.facebook.com/people/Artists-Hub-of-the-ACE-Basin-AHABs/100063695636818/), home of trial artist Jean Langston).|
|To a person, they defined service with a smile.|
|It extended to the citizens of Colleton County, too. One night in late February, reporter Arthur Cerf of Vanity Fair and I were invited to the home of some Walterboro residents to watch the premiere of the recently released Netflix documentary about the Murdaugh saga.|
| *“What do you think of our city?”* Cerf and I were asked by several of the party-goers as we sampled some of their delicious homemade chili.|
|Both writers by trade, we were already struggling to summon the words necessary to describe the genuine endearment and respect we felt for Walterboro and its people.|
| *“We are hope despite the times,”* Michael Stipe sang on R\.E\.M\.’s 1984 album Life’s Rich Pageant.|
|That is how I will always remember Walterboro, South Carolina. Hope despite the times. And a timely reminder of our innate goodness as people. At the very moment Murdaugh was hellbent on eroding our faith in humanity, the people of this community were busy restoring it.|
|Hill told me repeatedly before the trial that Walterboro couldn’t help the reason for the national spotlight – only how the community handled it. Well, they couldn’t have handled it any better – and I truly believe the example they set is responsible in no small part for the triumph of justice we saw last week.|
|Want to thank Walterboro? I hope you will join me and my family in coming *“back to the ‘Boro”* for the annual Colleton County [Rice Festival](https://ricefestival.org/) – scheduled for April 28-29, 2023. I’ll have a more detailed preview of that event in the weeks to come, but for now be sure to mark your calendars.|
|Until then … thank you, Walterboro.|
| **[Judge: Russell Laffitte, convicted of helping Murdaugh steal, not entitled to new trial](https://www.postandcourier.com/murdaugh-updates/judge-russell-laffitte-convicted-of-helping-murdaugh-steal-not-entitled-to-new-trial/article_a25f0794-bc3e-11ed-9a86-5fd5c00e9928.html)** |
|Former Hampton banker Russell Laffitte is not entitled to a new trial on allegations that he helped the disgraced and disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh steal money from clients, U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel ruled March 6.|
|The judge’s decision sets up the possibility of an appeal of Laffitte’s November conviction on six federal counts, including bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. Laffitte, the former chief executive of Palmetto State Bank, was the first defendant in the Murdaugh saga to face trial.|
|Laffitte readily admitted he played a role in some of Murdaugh’s thefts when he processed the checks the lawyer used to divert millions of dollars in client funds for his own benefit. But Laffitte contended he was an unwitting pawn who was unaware of Murdaugh’s schemes and simply carried out his customer’s requests.|
|To find Laffitte guilty, a jury had to conclude that he was a willing participant.|
|Murdaugh testified in February at his double-murder trial that Laffitte didn’t know what he was doing and didn’t conspire with him. But he refused to offer that testimony at Laffitte’s trial three months earlier, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.|
|Laffitte’s request for a new trial hinged in large part on the chaotic conclusion to the November proceedings, in which two jurors were replaced with alternates after several hours of debating the charges. As the deliberations, which began in the morning, stretched into the evening, one juror said she needed to take a time-sensitive antibiotic. Another said she was suffering severe anxiety.|
|Laffitte’s defense attorneys have argued these two jurors were holding out against a conviction. Once they were replaced, the reconstituted jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts in less than an hour.|
|In his March 6 decision, Gergel wrote that he stood by his decision to replace the two jurors. Laffitte’s defense team agreed to removing the juror who needed her medicine, the judge wrote, and it was plain to see that the other juror was experiencing *“significant emotional distress,”* becoming almost unable to speak.|
| *“It was obvious that she was unable to perform her duties as a juror,”* Gergel wrote. And when she said as much speaking with the judge, he continued, she *“effectively disqualified herself.”* |
|After the verdict, Laffitte hired Columbia attorney Mark Moore to lead a new defense team, which argued that the banker’s previous lawyers didn’t advocate for him effectively enough when the jury chaos emerged. Gergel disagreed; he found that the original team, led by Charleston attorneys Bart Daniel and Matt Austin, were simply dealing with an unusual and fluid situation.|
| *“Defendant does not get a ‘do over’ by replacing his first trial team with a new set of lawyers when he was not able to obtain the results he desired,”* the judge wrote.|
|Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Limehouse, who led Laffitte’s prosecution, declined to comment on the order, saying: *“We think the order speaks for itself.”* |
|Laffitte has yet to be sentenced on his six convictions. Once a formal conviction order is entered, he will be eligible to appeal the decision. |
|Moore, his new attorney, said Laffitte “respectfully disagrees with the order,” but declined to comment on the banker’s next steps.|

| **[2 brothers — one a deputy, one a juror — play key roles in Alex Murdaugh murder trial](https://www.postandcourier.com/murdaugh-updates/2-brothers-one-a-deputy-one-a-juror-play-key-roles-in-alex-murdaugh-murder/article_96f967fe-bd1b-11ed-8d4c-e7c9f2e93c9e.html)** |
|Two Colleton County brothers played an outsized role in the double-murder trial of the now-notorious Alex Murdaugh: One was the second deputy to arrive at the crime scene in June 2021. The other voted to convict him March 2. Juror James McDowell’s relationship to Colleton County Sheriff’s Cpl. Chad McDowell was not a secret. Answering questions as juror No. 530, James McDowell disclosed his family ties at least twice in open court during the jury selection process.|
|He was also pulled aside for further questioning by Judge Clifton Newman and the attorneys trying the case before both sides agreed to have him seated as an alternate. He made it onto the final panel when another juror took ill five weeks into trial. The day after James McDowell was sworn in as an alternate, his brother took the witness stand as the second person to testify. Chad McDowell described how he’d been on patrol with his police dog, Evo, when he was dispatched to Murdaugh’s sprawling, remote hunting estate, known as Moselle.|
|Jurors watched footage from his body camera, which showed the slain bodies of Murdaugh’s 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son Paul near Moselle’s dog kennels. It also showed the now-disbarred attorney greet him with a casual, friendly tone, asking him, *“How you doin’?”* Prosecutors used that interaction to cast suspicion on the emotion Murdaugh, 54, displayed in other moments.|
|The Murdaugh trial saw first responders — including Chad McDowell — come under repeated scrutiny for what his defense team described as missteps that threatened to disturb evidence. For instance, they called attention to how Chad McDowell traversed the crime scene before it was processed for evidence, placing bits of police tape near bullet casings he noticed. He testified that he wanted to make sure no one stepped on them; the State Law Enforcement Division had not yet arrived to take control of the scene. |
|At a supervisor’s direction, the deputy also walked into the kennels’ storage room, where Paul Murdaugh was fatally shot. McDowell was asked to help lift a sheet placed over the body to see if Paul had a weapon when he died. Defense attorney Dick Harpootlian questioned whether he could have destroyed evidence in the process.|
|James McDowell, 22, was not identified by name in court, but he has granted several on-camera interviews since the trial concluded. He did not respond to a request for comment from The Post and Courier.|
|In a “Fox and Friends” interview that aired March 7, James McDowell said his brother didn’t tell him much about what he saw after arriving home from the crime scene. He knew there had been a double homicide, but he said his brother was good about keeping work separate from his home life. He said he didn’t know how gruesome a scene his brother encountered at Moselle, and he said he was surprised he was picked for the jury given their relationship. *“There was no way that he would want to talk to me about that and make me go through that,”* James McDowell said. *“They followed up with, ‘Do you think you can be a fair and honest juror?’ And I told them that I would and that I could.”* |
|In a separate interview with Law & Crime, he said he was relatively removed from the case and the local grapevine prior to his selection: He was away from home attending Clemson University and now works in Charleston.|
|The defense had a strike remaining when James McDowell was seated on the jury. Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, another defense attorney for Murdaugh, did not respond to a request for comment about their thinking. Nor did a spokesman for the S.C. Attorney General’s Office, which prosecuted the case. *“I think they made a good decision because I think I was a fair and honest juror,”* James McDowell said. He said he was careful not to decide how he would vote until after closing arguments concluded.|
|University of South Carolina law professor Rob Wilcox, who teaches legal ethics, said Newman could have disqualified the juror if he felt he couldn’t be impartial. The fact that he didn’t suggests the judge was satisfied he could be fair, Wilcox said. The questions he faced from the judge would have focused on his bias, not the relationship itself, Wilcox said. In small counties, it can be difficult to find jurors who have no connection to a case.|
|That was particularly challenging in the Murdaugh trial, for which more than 250 potential witnesses were identified. Prospective jurors disclosed all manner of previous connections as they were questioned over two days: One was engaged to a first responder. Others had sold a truck to a witness, detailed cars for witnesses and installed HVAC systems for them. Even the clerk of court’s daughter was called for jury duty.|
|To address the web of connections, court officials sent questionnaires to some 900 possible jurors — more than 2 percent of Colleton County’s population.|

| **[‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial: ‘Egg Juror’ Doesn’t Want To Talk](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/03/08/murdaugh-murders-trial-egg-juror-doesnt-want-to-talk/)** |
|Attorney: “.*She earned through her public service the right to have her wishes respected.”* |
|One of the most bizarre (and decisive) moments of convicted killer Alex Murdaugh‘s double homicide trial unfolded just hours before his case was sent to a Colleton County, South Carolina jury last Thursday. I am referring, of course, to the infamous *“egg juror”* – who was relieved of her duties by S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman midway through closing arguments in the case.|
|Newman’s decision to remove the *“egg juror”* would ultimately prove pivotal to the unanimous guilty verdicts handed down against the disbarred lawyer – who was sentenced to life in prison last week for the savage slayings of his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and younger son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh. Maggie and Paul were brutally murdered on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the family’s 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatchie River on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties.|
|Newman removed the juror in question for allegedly having improper conversations with three individuals regarding *“evidence and testimony at that point in the trial.”* The juror compounded the problem by allegedly lying to Newman about these communications – violating his order that jurors not discuss the case with anyone (or each other).|
|After a two-day investigation into the allegations, Newman opted to remove the woman – juror No. 785 – *“in order to protect the integrity of the process.”* *“You have been by all accounts a great juror,”* Newman said, telling her she had *“smiled consistently, seemingly been attentive to the case and performed well.”* |
|Newman added he was *“not suggesting you intentionally did anything wrong”* – and thanked the juror for her service. |
|As she was being dismissed, Newman asked the juror whether she had anything remaining in the jury room.|
| *“A dozen eggs,”* she replied.|
| *“A dozen eggs?”* Newman responded, smiling.|
| *“You want to leave the eggs or take the eggs?”* the judge asked the juror, who indicated her desire to take them.|
| *“Mister bailiff: Can you retrieve from the jury room her dozen eggs?”* Newman said.|
|Here, in its entirety, is the “egg juror” [exchange as it unfolded last Thursday morning …](https://youtu.be/2_BGVhnN-CE) |
| *“As you know the identity of the jurors are confidential (and) not known to the public,” Newman told the juror. *“Cameras are not allowed to videotape the jurors and we have operated by juror numbers. Your identity will be kept confidential as long as the court is concerned.”*|
|This week, Columbia, S.C. attorney Joe McCulloch – a fixture at the Murdaugh trial – issued a statement on behalf of the “egg juror” asking the public and members of the media to stop trying to contact her.|
|*“I am reaching out to the press and public today on behalf of juror No. 785 who was excused from the jury in the State v. Murdaugh case just prior to deliberations,”* McCulloch said in the statement. *“I am requesting that everyone respect her privacy at both her home and her place of work. While other jurors have chosen to comment, which is their prerogative, that is not her desire at this time.”*  *“Given her public service for the weeks of trial, she earned through her public service the right to have her wishes respected,”* McCulloch added. *“She wishes you to know that she took the juror oath and all of the subsequent court’s instructions seriously and believes she followed them appropriately. She now wishes freedom from contact and harassment and requests that efforts to contact her at her home or work come to an immediate end. In that regard, we have requested the assistance of the Colleton County sheriff’s department. All further questions can be directed to my office.”* |
|As this news outlet reported last week, the “egg juror” – had she remained on the panel – would have likely wound up keeping the state from securing convictions against Murdaugh. |
| *“She was dug in,”* a source familiar with the deliberations confirmed. *“She said he was ‘not guilty’ and there was nothing anyone could do to change her mind.”* *“She would have hung the jury,”* another source confirmed.
