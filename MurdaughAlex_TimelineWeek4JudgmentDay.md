| [Reports: Alex Murdaugh To Take The Stand In His Own Defense](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/13/reports-alex-murdaugh-to-take-the-stand-in-his-own-defense/)<br>Risky business …<br>Multiple media outlets are reporting that disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh will take the stand in his own defense – assuming a Covid-19 outbreak on the jury doesn’t cause a mistrial in this high-profile double homicide case. The move – which would be incredibly risky – was reported almost simultaneously on Monday afternoon by Andrew Davis of WSAV TV-3 (NBC – Savannah) and Riley Benson of WCBD TV-2 (NBC – Charleston, S.C.). Both Davis and Benson cited a *“source close to the defense”* in their almost simultaneous tweets breaking the news.
Murdaugh’s attorneys have probably advised him against doing so (especially seeing as the state’s case doesn’t appear to have definitively linked him to the killings, at least not beyond a reasonable doubt). Putting Murdaugh on the stand would be a dangerous move for the defense – especially seeing as he has yet to explain why he lied to investigators (and others) about his whereabouts on the evening of the killings. |

|Two jurors tasked with deciding the fate of disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh have tested positive for coronavirus – prompting circuit court judge Clifton Newman to release them from duty and replace them with alternates. That leaves only three alternates remaining after one alternate juror was previously excused following a visit to the emergency room last week. More ominously, the positive tests raise the specter of a potential mistrial in the event the virus spreads amongst the remaining members of the jury. *“We have no way of knowing – we just have to take precautions,”* Newman said. *“We need twelve to deliberate. That’s why we have alternates.”* Newman said the remaining members of the jury were informed of the positive tests – and opted to remain at their posts. They will be subjected to a testing regimen over the coming days, Newman said – although as of this writing, no other positive tests have been reported. Newman declined to impose a mask mandate or enact social distancing within the courtroom. He also declined suggestions from both lead prosecutor Creighton Waters and lead defense attorney Dick Harpootlian to delay the proceedings for several days.|

|WALTERBORO — COVID-19 is threatening to derail Alex Murdaugh’s expensive, time-consuming and highly publicized double murder trial after two jurors who tested positive for the virus were sent home Feb. 13. Judge Clifton Newman’s dismissal of the two jurors set off alarms that an outbreak in the jury room could require a suspension of the weeks-long proceedings or, worse, a mistrial. A court employee also tested positive, Newman said. As the trial entered its fourth week, just three of the original six alternates remain to replace any other jurors who can’t go on. Another alternate was excused Feb. 7 after a separate health emergency.|
|The news seemed to catch Murdaugh defense attorney Dick Harpootlian and lead prosecutor Creighton Waters off guard. They suggested delaying the trial until Feb. 15, when Newman is scheduled to have the jury tested again. The proceedings are playing out in a jam-packed courtroom, with followers flocking to Walterboro from across the state and country.
They have lined up outside the Colleton County courthouse for hours each morning to secure a seat. They hope to watch as prosecutors try to prove that Murdaugh, a once-respected trial attorney, shot his wife and son to death in June 2021 at the family’s hunting estate.|
|Harpootlian suggested requiring masks in the crowded room, where the sounds of coughing and sniffling frequently echo over a Court TV livestream. Both sides asked Newman to enforce social distancing in the room, a move that would have required many of the 200-plus spectators to clear out. But Newman declined to issue any restrictions. He encouraged everyone to *“mask up”* and noted some members of the jury had already chosen to do so. A court official passed out masks to audience members, though most chose not to wear one. Newman added he had consulted with a doctor before going forward with the trial.|
|Both Waters and Harpootlian stressed they didn’t want a delay, even though they felt compelled to recommend one. Harpootlian said suspending the trial would be an *“economic disaster”* for the defense. Murdaugh’s legal team has already lined up pricey expert witnesses to testify for them once the state rests its case later this week. Waters told Judge Newman he expects to wrap up the state’s presentation on Feb. 15.|
|Harpootlian said he caught COVID-19 in December and that the virus wiped him out for three weeks even as he prepared for trial. He seemed in no rush to contract it again. After addressing the COVID-19 concerns, the state continued to present its case. Prosecutors have called 51 witnesses, including law enforcement officers, forensic analysts and Murdaugh’s former friends and colleagues, to establish how and why they believe the former Hampton attorney carried out the slayings.|
|Prosecutors have sought to portray Murdaugh, 54, as a con artist who stole nearly $9 million from those who trusted him and then slaughtered his wife and son in a desperate ploy to cover up those crimes. On Feb. 13, the jury heard from State Law Enforcement Division forensics analysts about the battery of DNA and blood tests investigators ran on Murdaugh’s clothes and other evidence found at the crime scene. Jurors learned that blood found on the steering wheel of Murdaugh’s 2021 Chevrolet Suburban contained DNA from both Alex and Maggie Murdaugh. The same was true for blood collected from a 12-gauge shotgun Murdaugh had when first responders arrived to the crime scene — the dog kennels of the family’s spacious estate. Alex Murdaugh’s shirt tested negative for human blood, but positive for DNA from 52-year-old Maggie, and others, the jury was told. A blue rain jacket that prosecutors have tried to link to Murdaugh had no DNA on its interior, cuffs or hood that could be used to identify its owner. The coat, found bundled in an upstairs closet in Murdaugh’s parents’ home, was covered in gunshot residue, jurors previously learned. |
|Prosecutors have theorized Murdaugh wrapped the murder weapons — which haven’t been recovered — in the coat before stashing them somewhere and hiding the jacket. In what has become a trend at Murdaugh’s trial, prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General’s Office didn’t spell out the relevance or significance of most of those test results for the jury. |
|Observers now expect prosecutors to connect those dots later in the trial, either while questioning SLED investigator David Owen this week or in closing arguments. Murdaugh’s defense team was happy to fill the void of explanation. Attorney Phillip Barber said the blood and DNA found on the Suburban’s steering wheel merely confirms what Murdaugh told investigators: that he checked Maggie’s bloody body for a pulse before driving the SUV back to the family’s house to retrieve a 12-gauge shotgun. Barber also seized on another piece of evidence the state left open-ended: Investigators found unidentified small amounts of male DNA under Maggie’s fingernails. SLED analyst Sara Zapata said she couldn’t say when or how that DNA wound up there: just that it didn’t belong to Alex or Paul Murdaugh, 22. |
|The day ended with Medical University of South Carolina forensic pathologist Dr. Ellen Riemer on the witness stand. Riemer performed Maggie and Paul’s autopsies. She testified in precise, gory detail about how the two were killed: Paul with a shotgun and Maggie with a .300 Blackout semiautomatic, military-style rifle. Stippling wounds on both victims indicate the pair were each shot from close range — just 3 feet, Riemer said. Neither had defensive wounds indicating a struggle, she said.|
|The jury seemed disturbed at the sight of graphic crime scene images, including photos of Paul’s blown-apart skull. One juror put her arm around another who was crying. Murdaugh sat a few feet away, crying and wiping his face with a wadded tissue as Riemer described Maggie and Paul’s wounds. The defense will begin cross-examining Riemer when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 14.|

|More puzzle pieces …|
|Prosecutors hoping to convict disbarred South Carolina Alex Murdaugh of the murders of his wife and son dropped a ton of additional puzzle pieces onto the table Monday – including extensive DNA evidence taken from the graphic crime scene near Islandton, S.C. As with much of the evidence and testimony previously submitted, though, there was limited narrative accompaniment … meaning jurors in this case are still waiting on witnesses to walk them through the state’s case *Who is going to put those puzzle pieces together?* As noted in previous coverage, that job would appear destined to fall to senior special agent David Owen – the lead case agent for the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Owen conducted all three law enforcement interviews with Murdaugh in the aftermath of the savage slayings of his family members. The video from Murdaugh’s second interview with Owen (conducted on June 10, 2021) was released by the court on Monday, incidentally. News of this interview was first reported by this news outlet the day after it took place. At the time of the interview, Murdaugh’s attorneys told us SLED was speaking with him *“just to tie up some loose ends”* – giving Murdaugh the opportunity to provide answers to a few *“open-ended questions”* regarding the slayings of his wife and son. *“They are closing the book on him as any sort of suspect,”* an attorney close to the Murdaugh family said at the time. Clearly not …|
|Three generations of Murdaughs served as S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor from 1920-2006, and Alex Murdaugh himself was a badge-carrying assistant solicitor at the time of the killings. As evidence was introduced in court on Monday, Owen was hard at work on his laptop editing a document entitled *“Murdaugh Murder Investigative Timeline.”* When will he be called to testify to that timeline? We shall see … but time is running out for the state (and the pressure is on to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt). Owen’s direct examination is expected to take at least a day, we are told.|
| Nonetheless, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters indicated to presiding judge Clifton Newman that the state was still on track to conclude its case against Murdaugh sometime Wednesday afternoon. In the meantime, assistant attorney general Savanna Goude spent several hours eliciting voluminous DNA testing results from SLED forensic scientist Sara Zapata. Zapata testified that she received 24 buccal swabs for comparison in the Murdaugh case, and proceeded to detail each one of them as she identified which of the individuals tested “contributed to the mixture.” Zapata then outlined the probabilities associated with each test result, introducing jurors to some numbers they had likely not heard before including *“sextillion,”* *“octillion,”* *“decillion,”* *“duodecillion”* and *“tredecillion,”* among others. Little context was provided as to what these numbers meant, however.|
| *“Missing from the state’s presentation of DNA are relatable comparisons of the significance of the numbers,”* our researcher Jenn Wood noted. *“The significance of all these numbers is going to be lost on the jury if they don’t explain the gravity of them.”* Murdaugh attorney Phil Barber also delivered an extremely effective cross-examination of Zapata – raising the fact that *“unidentified male DNA was found under Maggie’s fingernails.”* That DNA did not belong to either Alex or Paul Murdaugh. Barber also detailed disputed findings from Oklahoma-based blood spatter expert Tom Bevel – whose revised report regarding key forensic evidence placing Murdaugh at the crime scene at the very moment at least one of his victims was killed has not been submitted by prosecutors. Murdaugh attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin have accused SLED agents of *“badgering”* Bevel as part of their alleged *“bad-faith conduct”* intended to change his opinion on the blood spatter evidence.|
|While the state appeared to lose some ground during the DNA testimony, it brought home the chilling nature of this crime when it called forensic pathologist Ellen Riemer of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to the stand. In an unexpectedly upbeat (yet oddly effective) tone, Riemer whimsically walked through each of the gunshot wounds sustained by Paul and Maggie Murdaugh as though she were a museum curator describing the brush strokes of a famous artist. Riemer testified that both Maggie and Paul were shot at incredibly close range – approximately two-to-three feet for the initial shots to each victim. In describing the fatal head wound sustained by Paul Murdaugh, Riemer testified shotgun pellets impacted the left side of his head and caused a large exit wound on the rear, right side of his head. Murdaugh’s face was completely intact, however, indicating his head was turned to the left when he was shot the second time. Riemer stated this second shot was an *“extremely severe, immediately fatal injury”* – noting Murdaugh’s brain was ejected from his head and brought to the autopsy separately in a bucket. As for Maggie Murdaugh’s wounds, Riemer described the first two shots as striking her from the front at close range while she was standing. One of these shots was an entrance wound which traveled through her abdominal wall and several organs prior to exiting from the left side of her back. She was also shot through the left thigh with the projectile exiting through the back of her left thigh at the same time. These shots had a *“parallel trajectory,”* Riemer said. Maggie Murdaugh also sustained an entry and exit wound to her wrist – but like the first two wounds this one would not have been immediately fatal. A fourth projective entered on the side of Maggie Murdaugh’s left breast and exited from the top of her left chest, Riemer testified. This bullet proceeded upward and continued through the left side of her face and lower ear area. This fourth shot would have been immediately fatal as it entered her brain. Finally, a fifth projectile entered the back of Maggie Murdaugh’s head near the base of her skull and proceeded in a downward trajectory. As Riemer testified, Waters described Alex Murdaugh as *“circling”* her as she as she was lying fatally wounded on the ground.|
|Jurors were clearly impacted by what they saw – appearing extremely shaken as the graphic crime scene images and autopsy photos were shown. One juror cupped their hand over their mouth in horror during Riemer’s presentation. Another appeared to be wiping away a tear as an image of Maggie Murdaugh’s exit wounds was depicted on one of the two screens positioned in front of the jury.|
|As for Alex Murdaugh, he teared up on multiple occasions as the graphic testimony continued – as did several members of his family seated several rows behind him in court. At one point, Murdaugh appeared to be ripping a tissue in his hands and then attempting to press it back together. He later repeated this motion with a yellow highlighter – removing its cap and then placing it back over the marker. At another point, Murdaugh stared blankly ahead – rocking and nodding his head in what has become a signature response to particularly jarring testimony.|
|Riemer is scheduled to be on the stand for a *“lengthy”* cross-examination from Harpootlian when court reconvenes on Tuesday morning at 9:30 a.m. EST.|
