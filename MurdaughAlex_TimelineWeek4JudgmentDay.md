| [Reports: Alex Murdaugh To Take The Stand In His Own Defense](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/13/reports-alex-murdaugh-to-take-the-stand-in-his-own-defense/)<br>Risky business …<br>Multiple media outlets are reporting that disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh will take the stand in his own defense – assuming a Covid-19 outbreak on the jury doesn’t cause a mistrial in this high-profile double homicide case. The move – which would be incredibly risky – was reported almost simultaneously on Monday afternoon by Andrew Davis of WSAV TV-3 (NBC – Savannah) and Riley Benson of WCBD TV-2 (NBC – Charleston, S.C.). Both Davis and Benson cited a *“source close to the defense”* in their almost simultaneous tweets breaking the news.
Murdaugh’s attorneys have probably advised him against doing so (especially seeing as the state’s case doesn’t appear to have definitively linked him to the killings, at least not beyond a reasonable doubt). Putting Murdaugh on the stand would be a dangerous move for the defense – especially seeing as he has yet to explain why he lied to investigators (and others) about his whereabouts on the evening of the killings. |

|Two jurors tasked with deciding the fate of disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh have tested positive for coronavirus – prompting circuit court judge Clifton Newman to release them from duty and replace them with alternates. That leaves only three alternates remaining after one alternate juror was previously excused following a visit to the emergency room last week. More ominously, the positive tests raise the specter of a potential mistrial in the event the virus spreads amongst the remaining members of the jury. *“We have no way of knowing – we just have to take precautions,”* Newman said. *“We need twelve to deliberate. That’s why we have alternates.”* Newman said the remaining members of the jury were informed of the positive tests – and opted to remain at their posts. They will be subjected to a testing regimen over the coming days, Newman said – although as of this writing, no other positive tests have been reported. Newman declined to impose a mask mandate or enact social distancing within the courtroom. He also declined suggestions from both lead prosecutor Creighton Waters and lead defense attorney Dick Harpootlian to delay the proceedings for several days.|

|WALTERBORO — COVID-19 is threatening to derail Alex Murdaugh’s expensive, time-consuming and highly publicized double murder trial after two jurors who tested positive for the virus were sent home Feb. 13. Judge Clifton Newman’s dismissal of the two jurors set off alarms that an outbreak in the jury room could require a suspension of the weeks-long proceedings or, worse, a mistrial. A court employee also tested positive, Newman said. As the trial entered its fourth week, just three of the original six alternates remain to replace any other jurors who can’t go on. Another alternate was excused Feb. 7 after a separate health emergency.|
|The news seemed to catch Murdaugh defense attorney Dick Harpootlian and lead prosecutor Creighton Waters off guard. They suggested delaying the trial until Feb. 15, when Newman is scheduled to have the jury tested again. The proceedings are playing out in a jam-packed courtroom, with followers flocking to Walterboro from across the state and country.
They have lined up outside the Colleton County courthouse for hours each morning to secure a seat. They hope to watch as prosecutors try to prove that Murdaugh, a once-respected trial attorney, shot his wife and son to death in June 2021 at the family’s hunting estate.|
|Harpootlian suggested requiring masks in the crowded room, where the sounds of coughing and sniffling frequently echo over a Court TV livestream. Both sides asked Newman to enforce social distancing in the room, a move that would have required many of the 200-plus spectators to clear out. But Newman declined to issue any restrictions. He encouraged everyone to *“mask up”* and noted some members of the jury had already chosen to do so. A court official passed out masks to audience members, though most chose not to wear one. Newman added he had consulted with a doctor before going forward with the trial.|
|Both Waters and Harpootlian stressed they didn’t want a delay, even though they felt compelled to recommend one. Harpootlian said suspending the trial would be an *“economic disaster”* for the defense. Murdaugh’s legal team has already lined up pricey expert witnesses to testify for them once the state rests its case later this week. Waters told Judge Newman he expects to wrap up the state’s presentation on Feb. 15.|
|Harpootlian said he caught COVID-19 in December and that the virus wiped him out for three weeks even as he prepared for trial. He seemed in no rush to contract it again. After addressing the COVID-19 concerns, the state continued to present its case. Prosecutors have called 51 witnesses, including law enforcement officers, forensic analysts and Murdaugh’s former friends and colleagues, to establish how and why they believe the former Hampton attorney carried out the slayings.|
|Prosecutors have sought to portray Murdaugh, 54, as a con artist who stole nearly $9 million from those who trusted him and then slaughtered his wife and son in a desperate ploy to cover up those crimes. On Feb. 13, the jury heard from State Law Enforcement Division forensics analysts about the battery of DNA and blood tests investigators ran on Murdaugh’s clothes and other evidence found at the crime scene. Jurors learned that blood found on the steering wheel of Murdaugh’s 2021 Chevrolet Suburban contained DNA from both Alex and Maggie Murdaugh. The same was true for blood collected from a 12-gauge shotgun Murdaugh had when first responders arrived to the crime scene — the dog kennels of the family’s spacious estate. Alex Murdaugh’s shirt tested negative for human blood, but positive for DNA from 52-year-old Maggie, and others, the jury was told. A blue rain jacket that prosecutors have tried to link to Murdaugh had no DNA on its interior, cuffs or hood that could be used to identify its owner. The coat, found bundled in an upstairs closet in Murdaugh’s parents’ home, was covered in gunshot residue, jurors previously learned. |
|Prosecutors have theorized Murdaugh wrapped the murder weapons — which haven’t been recovered — in the coat before stashing them somewhere and hiding the jacket. In what has become a trend at Murdaugh’s trial, prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General’s Office didn’t spell out the relevance or significance of most of those test results for the jury. |
|Observers now expect prosecutors to connect those dots later in the trial, either while questioning SLED investigator David Owen this week or in closing arguments. Murdaugh’s defense team was happy to fill the void of explanation. Attorney Phillip Barber said the blood and DNA found on the Suburban’s steering wheel merely confirms what Murdaugh told investigators: that he checked Maggie’s bloody body for a pulse before driving the SUV back to the family’s house to retrieve a 12-gauge shotgun. Barber also seized on another piece of evidence the state left open-ended: Investigators found unidentified small amounts of male DNA under Maggie’s fingernails. SLED analyst Sara Zapata said she couldn’t say when or how that DNA wound up there: just that it didn’t belong to Alex or Paul Murdaugh, 22. |
|The day ended with Medical University of South Carolina forensic pathologist Dr. Ellen Riemer on the witness stand. Riemer performed Maggie and Paul’s autopsies. She testified in precise, gory detail about how the two were killed: Paul with a shotgun and Maggie with a .300 Blackout semiautomatic, military-style rifle. Stippling wounds on both victims indicate the pair were each shot from close range — just 3 feet, Riemer said. Neither had defensive wounds indicating a struggle, she said.|
|The jury seemed disturbed at the sight of graphic crime scene images, including photos of Paul’s blown-apart skull. One juror put her arm around another who was crying. Murdaugh sat a few feet away, crying and wiping his face with a wadded tissue as Riemer described Maggie and Paul’s wounds. The defense will begin cross-examining Riemer when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 14.|

|More puzzle pieces …|
|Prosecutors hoping to convict disbarred South Carolina Alex Murdaugh of the murders of his wife and son dropped a ton of additional puzzle pieces onto the table Monday – including extensive DNA evidence taken from the graphic crime scene near Islandton, S.C. As with much of the evidence and testimony previously submitted, though, there was limited narrative accompaniment … meaning jurors in this case are still waiting on witnesses to walk them through the state’s case *Who is going to put those puzzle pieces together?* As noted in previous coverage, that job would appear destined to fall to senior special agent David Owen – the lead case agent for the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Owen conducted all three law enforcement interviews with Murdaugh in the aftermath of the savage slayings of his family members. The video from Murdaugh’s second interview with Owen (conducted on June 10, 2021) was released by the court on Monday, incidentally. News of this interview was first reported by this news outlet the day after it took place. At the time of the interview, Murdaugh’s attorneys told us SLED was speaking with him *“just to tie up some loose ends”* – giving Murdaugh the opportunity to provide answers to a few *“open-ended questions”* regarding the slayings of his wife and son. *“They are closing the book on him as any sort of suspect,”* an attorney close to the Murdaugh family said at the time. Clearly not …|
|Three generations of Murdaughs served as S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor from 1920-2006, and Alex Murdaugh himself was a badge-carrying assistant solicitor at the time of the killings. As evidence was introduced in court on Monday, Owen was hard at work on his laptop editing a document entitled *“Murdaugh Murder Investigative Timeline.”* When will he be called to testify to that timeline? We shall see … but time is running out for the state (and the pressure is on to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt). Owen’s direct examination is expected to take at least a day, we are told.|
| Nonetheless, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters indicated to presiding judge Clifton Newman that the state was still on track to conclude its case against Murdaugh sometime Wednesday afternoon. In the meantime, assistant attorney general Savanna Goude spent several hours eliciting voluminous DNA testing results from SLED forensic scientist Sara Zapata. Zapata testified that she received 24 buccal swabs for comparison in the Murdaugh case, and proceeded to detail each one of them as she identified which of the individuals tested “contributed to the mixture.” Zapata then outlined the probabilities associated with each test result, introducing jurors to some numbers they had likely not heard before including *“sextillion,”* *“octillion,”* *“decillion,”* *“duodecillion”* and *“tredecillion,”* among others. Little context was provided as to what these numbers meant, however.|
| *“Missing from the state’s presentation of DNA are relatable comparisons of the significance of the numbers,”* our researcher Jenn Wood noted. *“The significance of all these numbers is going to be lost on the jury if they don’t explain the gravity of them.”* Murdaugh attorney Phil Barber also delivered an extremely effective cross-examination of Zapata – raising the fact that *“unidentified male DNA was found under Maggie’s fingernails.”* That DNA did not belong to either Alex or Paul Murdaugh. Barber also detailed disputed findings from Oklahoma-based blood spatter expert Tom Bevel – whose revised report regarding key forensic evidence placing Murdaugh at the crime scene at the very moment at least one of his victims was killed has not been submitted by prosecutors. Murdaugh attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin have accused SLED agents of *“badgering”* Bevel as part of their alleged *“bad-faith conduct”* intended to change his opinion on the blood spatter evidence.|
|While the state appeared to lose some ground during the DNA testimony, it brought home the chilling nature of this crime when it called forensic pathologist Ellen Riemer of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to the stand. In an unexpectedly upbeat (yet oddly effective) tone, Riemer whimsically walked through each of the gunshot wounds sustained by Paul and Maggie Murdaugh as though she were a museum curator describing the brush strokes of a famous artist. Riemer testified that both Maggie and Paul were shot at incredibly close range – approximately two-to-three feet for the initial shots to each victim. In describing the fatal head wound sustained by Paul Murdaugh, Riemer testified shotgun pellets impacted the left side of his head and caused a large exit wound on the rear, right side of his head. Murdaugh’s face was completely intact, however, indicating his head was turned to the left when he was shot the second time. Riemer stated this second shot was an *“extremely severe, immediately fatal injury”* – noting Murdaugh’s brain was ejected from his head and brought to the autopsy separately in a bucket. As for Maggie Murdaugh’s wounds, Riemer described the first two shots as striking her from the front at close range while she was standing. One of these shots was an entrance wound which traveled through her abdominal wall and several organs prior to exiting from the left side of her back. She was also shot through the left thigh with the projectile exiting through the back of her left thigh at the same time. These shots had a *“parallel trajectory,”* Riemer said. Maggie Murdaugh also sustained an entry and exit wound to her wrist – but like the first two wounds this one would not have been immediately fatal. A fourth projective entered on the side of Maggie Murdaugh’s left breast and exited from the top of her left chest, Riemer testified. This bullet proceeded upward and continued through the left side of her face and lower ear area. This fourth shot would have been immediately fatal as it entered her brain. Finally, a fifth projectile entered the back of Maggie Murdaugh’s head near the base of her skull and proceeded in a downward trajectory. As Riemer testified, Waters described Alex Murdaugh as *“circling”* her as she as she was lying fatally wounded on the ground.|
|Jurors were clearly impacted by what they saw – appearing extremely shaken as the graphic crime scene images and autopsy photos were shown. One juror cupped their hand over their mouth in horror during Riemer’s presentation. Another appeared to be wiping away a tear as an image of Maggie Murdaugh’s exit wounds was depicted on one of the two screens positioned in front of the jury.|
|As for Alex Murdaugh, he teared up on multiple occasions as the graphic testimony continued – as did several members of his family seated several rows behind him in court. At one point, Murdaugh appeared to be ripping a tissue in his hands and then attempting to press it back together. He later repeated this motion with a yellow highlighter – removing its cap and then placing it back over the marker. At another point, Murdaugh stared blankly ahead – rocking and nodding his head in what has become a signature response to particularly jarring testimony.|
|Riemer is scheduled to be on the stand for a *“lengthy”* cross-examination from Harpootlian when court reconvenes on Tuesday morning at 9:30 a.m. EST.|

| WALTERBORO — In the weeks after Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were brutally shot to death, their relatives were terrified, Maggie’s sister testified Feb. 14. Investigators had made no arrests nor named any suspects. No motive was clear for the shocking slayings of two members of the prominent Hampton family. Yet Alex Murdaugh, Maggie’s husband and Paul’s father, didn’t seem concerned for his own safety, his sister-in-law Marian Proctor told a Colleton County jury in her first public remarks since the killings. In the aftermath of the slayings, Murdaugh spoke about wanting to *“clear Paul’s name”* in a wrongful death lawsuit over a fatal 2019 boat crash, Proctor tearfully recalled. Murdaugh also mentioned plans to get his other son, Buster, back into law school after a hiatus, Proctor said.
But Murdaugh — now standing trial on charges he fatally shot his wife and son — *“never talked”* about finding the person responsible for killing Maggie and Paul, Proctor testified. *“It was just odd,”* Maggie’s older sister said. *“We were sort of living in fear because we thought this horrible person was out there. We were mostly afraid for Alex and Buster, but we didn’t know the motive behind the killings. We thought it probably had something to do with the boat case.”* She added: *“We thought that up until September. And then things started to change a little bit.”* |
|That’s when the family learned Murdaugh had lost his job amid allegations he had stolen money from his law firm and clients. Maggie’s relatives have strictly avoided the harsh spotlight of the Murdaugh saga since the June 7, 2021, slayings — issuing no public statements and agreeing to no interviews. Proctor’s testimony, delivered in the trial’s fourth week, offered the public’s first insight into the family’s reaction to the slayings and the investigation that concluded Murdaugh was responsible.|
|Called to the witness stand by state prosecutors, Proctor did not go out of her way to defend Murdaugh. She went on at length at some points to recall aspects of his behavior after the slayings that struck her as unusual. Murdaugh’s defense attorneys have worked to cultivate an image of their client as a loving father and husband who was incapable of executing his wife and son in such gory fashion. Proctor’s testimony helped them in some respects. She said her sister was happy. She described Maggie and Alex’s marriage as *“good,”* but not perfect.|
|With the jury excused from the room, Proctor testified about Maggie’s suspicions that her husband had an affair back in 2007. Murdaugh defense attorney Jim Griffin asserted her fears turned out to be unfounded. But Proctor said Maggie had tossed Alex out of the house for some time as a result. Though the couple put the issue behind them, Maggie still brought it up to her sister sometimes, and *“it still bothered her,”* Proctor testified.|
|Judge Clifton Newman pondered her statements for about 15 minutes before ruling the jury shouldn’t hear about the suspected affair. Newman said the allegations were too old and not clearly linked to the slayings. But Newman did allow jurors to hear Proctor testify that her sister knew Murdaugh had been abusing painkillers. According to Proctor, Maggie had called Paul a *“little detective,”* because of his commitment to finding his father’s pills and making sure he was *“behaving.”* Proctor said Maggie had expressed concerns to her about her husband’s drug use, which had gone on *“for some time.”* |
|Murdaugh entered rehab for a reported opioid addiction in the days after his law partners confronted him in September 2021 about allegedly stealing millions of dollars. While on the stand, Proctor also helped humanize Maggie, 52, a little-understood figure at the heart of the Murdaugh story. Most of the prior testimony about Murdaugh’s family life has centered on his close relationship with Paul, 22, his youngest son. Proctor described Maggie as a doting stay-at-home mother who attended all of her sons’ sporting events and accompanied them on hunts, even though she was a *“girl’s girl”* with little appetite for the outdoors. Maggie preferred the family’s home on Edisto Beach to their Colleton County hunting lodge, located on a spacious property the Murdaughs called *“Moselle,”* Proctor said. 
Proctor recalled speaking with Maggie the afternoon of June 7 and encouraging her to go to Moselle to support her husband as his father’s health deteriorated. She cried on the stand as she testified it was her last conversation with her only sibling.|
|In the weeks and months after the slayings, Murdaugh stayed with relatives, including Maggie’s parents. He did not spend another night at the Moselle house, several witnesses have testified. During that period, Proctor said, she thought it was strange that Murdaugh described clearing Paul’s name in the boat crash case as his *“No. 1 goal.”* *“My No. 1 goal was to find out who killed my sister and Paul,”* Proctor said. *“I know he must have wanted that too. But I don’t know how he could have thought about anything else.”* |
|Proctor was the state’s 55th witness in what has become a marathon trial. Prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General’s Office said last week they planned to rest their case by Feb. 15, but that target appears to be slipping away: They moved late Feb. 14 to tell the jury about yet another thread in the tangled Murdaugh saga. Among the witnesses still to testify: State Law Enforcement Division agent David Owen, who led the investigation into the Murdaugh killings. Owen is expected to testify at length about the probe and explain how evidence presented over the past three weeks incriminates Murdaugh and excludes other suspects. Murdaugh’s legal team will likely cross-examine Owen exhaustively. They have alleged investigators littered the case with avoidable blunders and focused too narrowly on their client from day one, ignoring other possibilities. The trial will resume at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 15 with arguments over the admissibility of evidence regarding Murdaugh’s roadside shooting over Labor Day weekend 2021.|
|Prosecutors say the shooting helps prove a pattern: When Murdaugh is confronted with crisis, he concocts violent schemes to portray himself as a victim. They allege Murdaugh killed Maggie and Paul to buy time to cover up his previous alleged financial crimes. They note Murdaugh orchestrated his own shooting on the side of a Hampton County road shortly after his law firm confronted him over those thefts and forced him to resign. |
|Murdaugh’s legal team says that theory is nonsensical. The only reason Murdaugh is alive today is because his alleged shooter, a disabled trucker named Curtis Edward Smith, failed to kill him, only grazing the side of his head, defense attorney Dick Harpootlian said. *“He didn’t do it to get some sort of sympathy,”* Harpootlian argued. *“He did it to be dead. That’s why he did it.”* |

|And another battle over admissibility ensues …|
|The double homicide trial of disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh nearly ‘jumped the shark” on Tuesday afternoon as extramarital affair allegations were leveled at the man at the center of the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga. These allegations were made outside the presence of the jury, however, and S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman – who has done a masterful job thus far of keeping these proceedings on the rails – ruled any testimony related to the allegations inadmissible. The affair allegations were raised by lead prosecutor Creighton Waters during the testimony of Marian Proctor, the sister of the late Maggie Murdaugh. According to Proctor, her sister confided to her on multiple occasions about an alleged affair involving Alex Murdaugh and an unidentified woman that took place *“several years ago.”* While the Murdaughs reconciled in the aftermath of this alleged dalliance, Proctor testified in camera (outside the presence of the jury) that Maggie Murdaugh made her husband leave the house at the time – and that she brought it up in conversation as recently as 2020.
The  jarring admission – which prosecutors sought to include as a counter to the defense’s pervasive *“loving family”* narrative – was not allowed by Newman. *“She cannot testify to fidelity issues,”* Newman ruled after hearing arguments from Waters and defense attorney Jim Griffin.|
|Still, Proctor provided damning testimony about Alex Murdaugh’s demeanor in the aftermath of the double homicide. *“I thought his priority should have been on finding out who killed Maggie and Paul,”* Proctor said during cross-examination from Griffin. *“He never talked about that – about finding who had done it. It was just odd … we thought this horrible person was out there.”* *“We were afraid – we didn’t know what was going on,”* she testified, adding that *“Alex didn’t seem to be afraid.”* |
|Over Griffin’s objection, Newman did allow Proctor to testify to her knowledge of a bizarre September 2021 roadside shooting incident in which Murdaugh allegedly hired his longtime friend and alleged drug dealer/ check casher Curtis “Eddie” Smith to shoot him in the head. The stated goal of this shooting? To allow Murdaugh’s surviving son, Buster Murdaugh, to collect on a $10 million life insurance policy. According to prosecutors, the roadside shooting incident – which occurred hours after Murdaugh was confronted by his best friend Chris Wilson over $192,000 he had stolen from him – was not a botched suicide attempt but rather another attempted deflection by Murdaugh, a perpetuation of the false narrative that he and his family were being targeted by vigilantes following a high-profile 2019 boat crash involving his late son Paul Murdaugh.|
|*“Oh my gosh, the real killers are back,”* Waters told the court, paraphrasing Murdaugh’s *“intended effect.”* *“The real killers are back to finish the job,”* Waters added. |
|Murdaugh stands accused of killing his wife and son on his family’s hunting property near Islandton, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and is currently standing trial in Walterboro, S.C. – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which the Murdaugh family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century.  Three generations of Murdaughs served as S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor from 1920-2006, and Alex Murdaugh himself was a badge-carrying assistant solicitor at the time of the killings.|
|At the heart of the prosecution’s double homicide case against Murdaugh is the belief the 54-year-old former lawyer killed his family to evade scrutiny over his looming exposure as a fraudster and a thief. Prosecutors – who have indicted Murdaugh on 99 counts of alleged financial crimes – have maintained he wanted to pin the blame for the killings (and the roadside shooting) on vigilantes intent on avenging Mallory Beach, a 19-year-old who died on February 24, 2019 when Paul Murdaugh crashed his father’s fishing boat into a Beaufort County bridge while *“grossly intoxicated.”* Paul Murdaugh was staring down three felony boating under the influence charges – and a lengthy potential prison stint – at the time he was killed. Alex Murdaugh was also staring down significant financial liability in connection with a wrongful death suit filed on behalf of Beach’s family by attorney Mark Tinsley. In the immediate aftermath of the June 2021 double homicide, Alex Murdaugh pointed police to the boat crash as the reason his wife and son were killed. And in the immediate aftermath of the roadside shooting, Murdaugh tried to claim he was shot by an unknown passerby as he attempted to change a flat tire on his late wife’s Mercedes SUV.|
| *“They pulled over like they were gonna help me … when I turned my back they tried to shoot me,”* Murdaugh said on a 9-1-1 call following the incident. That narrative quickly collapsed, however … Prosecutors have claimed there is a *“symmetry”* to these events – namely Murdaugh’s use of them to try and manipulate public opinion (and his own family members). Based on the testimony of his own sister-in-law, it worked … at least initially.|
| *“I thought they were being targeted,”* Proctor testified. *“I thought the family was being targeted. I thought whoever killed Maggie and Paul had shot Alex. I was terrified Buster was next.”* |
|Murdaugh attorney Dick Harpootlian rebuked the notion that his client used the roadside shooting to advance the vigilante narrative, insisting *“he intended to die.”* *“He didn’t do it to get sympathy, he did it to get dead,”* Harpootlian told Newman. *“Unfortunately, Eddie Smith at four feet couldn’t kill him.”* Newman expressed an interest in hearing testimony from Smith, who was subpoenaed by the state but has yet to be called to the witness stand. *“He’s on the witness list,”* Waters told the judge. *“I didn’t necessarily say we were calling him.”*  Assuming he is called, Smith is expected to tell jurors that Murdaugh admitted to killing his family during their exchange on the side of Old Salkehatchie Road on September 4, 2021.|
|Prosecutors had planned on calling senior special agent David Owen to the stand on Tuesday, but Owen had a death in the family and was unavailable to testify. Owen is expected to be back in Walterboro on Wednesday and could take the stand as early as Wednesday morning, we are told. His testimony is considered critical to the state’s discombobulated case – which has been all over the map up to this point. According to my sources, Owen will walk jurors through all of the previously introduced evidence and testimony – lending some badly needed chronology and cohesion to the prosecution’s narrative of these crimes. |
|Just as prosecutors appeared to be getting their case organized, though, another interesting (and potentially paradigm-shifting) wrinkle emerged during Proctor’s testimony. According to Proctor, Maggie Murdaugh had nickname for her younger son – *“little detective.”* *“He was always looking to see that his dad was behaving,”* Proctor said. |
| *“What was his concern?”* Waters asked.|
| *“Pills – prescription painkillers,”* Proctor responded. *”If there were pills in the home his dad wasn’t supposed to be taking it was Paul’s job to take them.”* |
|Up to this point, there has been no indication drugs played a role in Murdaugh’s alleged motive in this case. In fact, the state has focused exclusively (and exhaustively) on the looming threat of exposure for his financial crimes as the reason he allegedly killed his wife and son. Is this a last-minute narrative shift? We shall see …|
|Testimony is scheduled to resume on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EST after Newman hears from both prosecutors and defense attorneys regarding the admissibility of evidence and testimony related to the roadside shooting.|

|WALTERBORO — The lead investigator of the high-profile murders of Alex Murdaugh’s wife and son admitted Feb. 15 he was unaware until four months after Murdaugh’s indictment that the defendant’s white T-shirt from the night of the slayings had tested negative for human blood. State Law Enforcement Division agent David Owen testified he didn’t mean to mislead the grand jury shortly before it indicted Murdaugh in the June 2021 killings when he told them Murdaugh’s T-shirt was covered in high-impact blood spatter. Such spatter stains would indicate Murdaugh was standing just feet away as Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot to death. In response to withering cross-examination by defense attorney Jim Griffin, Owen said he didn’t get an email notification about the negative blood test by SLED’s forensic lab. He testified he learned of its existence only months ago, after Murdaugh’s legal team raised concerns that an outside expert had claimed to find blood spatter on a shirt with no blood. *“How is it the lead case agent is left out of the information channel for something so significant?”* Griffin asked.|
|Owen was expected to be a star witness for the S.C. Attorney General’s Office when he took the witness stand Feb. 15. Legal analysts predicted Owen would help tie together the state’s case, walking Colleton County jurors through the meandering trail of evidence they have heard about over the trial’s first four weeks. Owen did that, to some degree. Prosecutors played a video of his final interview with Murdaugh on Aug. 11, 2021, in which Owen confronted the soon-to-be disgraced Hampton trial attorney with inconsistencies in his story and asked him point-blank whether he killed his wife and son. But on cross-examination, Griffin delivered blow after blow to the credibility of Owen’s investigation and the state’s case. Griffin established that Owen had given the grand jury bad information about blood spatter, once thought to be a central element of the state’s case. (Prosecutors haven’t mentioned spatter a single time at Murdaugh’s trial, in large part because Murdaugh’s defense team found the negative blood test during pre-trial discovery.) Owen admitted he also misinformed the grand jury that shotguns loaded in the same fashion apparently used to kill Paul had been found at the Murdaughs’ Colleton County hunting estate. Owen had given the same incorrect information to Murdaugh, 54, in their August 2021 interview, a decision he defended in court Feb. 15.|
| *“I’m allowed to use trickery to elicit a response,”* he told Griffin of the interview. Griffin then asked if Owen had also meant to *“trick the grand jury.”* Owen said no. Then, Griffin had him read his own testimony showing he gave the investigative panel incorrect information.|
|In his earlier testimony on Feb. 15, Owen told the jury about a series of inconsistencies in Murdaugh’s story to investigators about the night of the slayings. They included Murdaugh’s since-disproven claim that he was never with his wife and son by their hunting estate’s dog kennels on June 7, 2021, before discovering their bloody bodies there later that night. Multiple witnesses have testified they can hear Murdaugh’s voice in the background of a video Paul recorded on his phone at 8:44 p.m., just minutes before his phone and his mother’s phone stopped answering messages or calls. But on cross-examination, Griffin focused on inconsistencies and flaws in the ensuing murder investigation that led to Murdaugh’s indictment. He sought to establish that state agents trained on Murdaugh from the beginning and bungled parts of their investigation that could have exonerated him or implicated other suspects.|
|Law enforcement failed to dust parts of the crime scene for fingerprint evidence, failed to conduct a thorough search of Murdaugh’s home and never once asked Murdaugh for the khaki pants and Columbia-style fishing shirt he was wearing earlier on the day of the slayings, Griffin established. Prosecutors now seem to imply that Murdaugh was wearing those clothes when he allegedly killed Maggie and Paul, then stashed them somewhere and changed into the white T-shirt and green shorts he wore when first responders arrived. Investigators didn’t test Maggie and Paul’s clothes for DNA, and they didn’t identify a mystery male’s DNA that was found under Maggie’s fingernails, Griffin noted. SLED also failed to search Murdaughs’ parents’ home until three months after the killings, Owen acknowledged, even though prosecutors have now openly speculated that Murdaugh hid the murder weapons there before disposing of them for good later. Owen said he didn’t think at the time that he had the probable cause needed to seek a search warrant for the property.|
| *“Would you agree that was an opportunity missed?”* Griffin asked. *“Probably, yes,”* Owen replied. Griffin solicited testimony that investigators found no DNA, blood, stains or gunshot residue in the back of Murdaugh’s 2021 Chevrolet Suburban to support the theory that Murdaugh carried the murder weapons with him when he drove to his parents’ house that evening to visit his mother. The murder weapons — a 12-gauge shotgun used to kill 22-year-old Paul and a .300 Blackout semiautomatic rifle used to kill Maggie, 52 — are still missing, according to testimony offered at trial.
Under questioning, Owen acknowledged that investigators showed the blue jacket to a number of Murdaugh’s relatives in an effort to link it to him. *“Not a single family member recognized that blue rain jacket,”* Griffin said. *“No, they did not,”* Owen conceded.|
|Earlier in the day, prosecutors showed the jury the never-before-seen video of Murdaugh’s final SLED interview in August 2021. Murdaugh and his best friend-turned-defense attorney, Beaufort lawyer Cory Fleming, seemed to be on edge going in. Fleming said he thought Murdaugh was meeting with SLED for an update on the case. He was surprised to learn agents Owen and Jeff Croft had questions for Murdaugh as well. *“Are you asking him questions to further your investigation,”* Fleming asked, *“or are you asking him questions because you think he’s a suspect?”* *“I am asking these questions to further my investigation,”* Owen replied. Eventually, Fleming allowed the interview to proceed. In polite and understanding tones, Owen and Croft bounced from subject to subject as they peppered Murdaugh with questions.|

Eventually, Fleming allowed the interview to proceed. In polite and understanding tones, Owen and Croft bounced from subject to subject as they peppered Murdaugh with questions. At times, they seemed to express sympathy for Murdaugh. Owen once said Murdaugh was the only person in the world who wanted the murders solved more than him. But in other moments, they confronted Murdaugh with information they had gathered that conflicted with his statements to investigators in the hours and days after the killings. Owen asked Murdaugh about his contention that he never saw Maggie and Paul at the dog kennels that night, for example. Owen then told Murdaugh investigators had spoken with one of Paul’s friends, Rogan Gibson, who said he spoke with Paul on the phone around 8:40 p.m. and heard Murdaugh’s voice in the background. Murdaugh was aware. *“Rogan Gibson asked me if I was up there,”* Murdaugh said. *“He said he thought it was me.”* *“Was it you?”* Owen asked. *“At 9 o’clock? No, sir,”* Murdaugh said. *“Not if my times are right.”* |
|Owen told Murdaugh that shell casings found around Maggie’s body matched older casings found elsewhere on the hunting estate, indicating she was killed with a family weapon. He told Murdaugh he was having difficulty wrapping his head around the timeline of that evening, in part because of inconsistencies in Murdaugh’s recollection of that day. At the end of the interview, Owen said he had just a few more questions. In a matter-of-fact voice, he asked, *“Did you kill Maggie?”* *“No,”* Murdaugh said. *“Did I kill my wife? No, David.”* *“Do you know who did?”* Owen asked. *“No, I do not know who did,”* Murdaugh said. Owens asked the same questions about Paul, and Murdaugh gave the same answers. Then it was Murdaugh’s turn to ask the questions. He asked whether Owen thought he killed Maggie and Paul. Owen juggled his hands. *“I have to go where the evidence and the facts take me,”* he said, *“and I don’t have anything that points at anybody else at this time.”*  |

| WALTERBORO — Jurors in Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial on Feb. 16 heard the once-prominent Hampton attorney confess to an entirely different crime: trying to orchestrate his own murder to leave behind a $10 million life insurance payout for his son. *“I was in a very bad place,”* Murdaugh told state investigators in a September 2021 phone call that the public had never heard before. *“I thought it would be better for me not to be here anymore. I thought that it would make it easier on my family for me to be dead.”* |
|As they prepared to rest their case, prosecutors played a tape of the call to prove a key point in their theory that Murdaugh killed his wife, Maggie, and son Paul: When Murdaugh is confronted with crisis, violence happens. Prosecutors note the September 2021 assisted suicide scheme came just one day after Murdaugh’s law partners confronted him with evidence he had stolen millions from his law firm and legal clients, then forced him to resign. They say Murdaugh, 54, faced a similar crisis three months earlier, just hours before his wife and son were brutally killed at the family’s spacious estate. A bookkeeper at Murdaugh’s law firm approached him and demanded proof he hadn’t taken some $792,000 in legal fees owed to the firm. The S.C. Attorney General’s Office alleges Murdaugh killed Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, to engender sympathy for himself and buy time to come up with those fees and avoid the exposure of his financial crimes. And the slayings did delay that reckoning: His law firm backed off its inquiry about the missing fees and rallied to Murdaugh’s aid, witnesses have testified. |
|Murdaugh, now disbarred, has denied any involvement in Maggie and Paul’s slayings. Throughout the first four weeks of his murder trial at the Colleton County Courthouse, his attorneys have sought to show the state charged Murdaugh with murder because incompetent investigators failed to collect potentially critical evidence that could have exonerated Murdaugh or incriminated other suspects. Murdaugh’s lawyers say state prosecutors are highlighting their client’s other wrongdoing — including the staged shooting and his alleged decadelong crime spree — to bolster their weak murder case with unrelated evidence. |
|Prosecutors on Feb. 16 played for jurors a tape of Murdaugh’s Sept. 13, 2021, interview with his attorneys, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, and State Law Enforcement Division investigator Ryan Kelly. Murdaugh and his attorneys called Kelly from the Atlanta rehab facility where Murdaugh was receiving treatment for opioid abuse.  During the call, Murdaugh repeatedly apologized for lying to investigators about the shooting. Initially, he told them he had been shot by an unknown assailant as he stopped to inspect a flat tire on the side of a rural Hampton County road. During this interview, he confessed he knew the news of his resignation and his myriad thefts were about to come out, and he wanted to die. He said he called his drug dealer, a disabled trucker named Curtis Edward Smith, and the two met to discuss killing Murdaugh. Murdaugh figured his surviving son, Buster, could collect on his $10 million life insurance policy. *“I knew I was about to lose everything, and I figured he was better off that way than dealing with me,”* Murdaugh told Kelly in the tape. |
|As his name was invoked on the tape, Buster bent forward in his seat in the courtroom. In the call, Murdaugh said Smith was a little surprised at his request but didn’t take much convincing. The two drove off toward Old Salkehatchie Road. There, Murdaugh said, he punctured his own tire with a knife and tossed it into the grass across the road. Murdaugh said he gave Smith a .38 revolver and stood still as Smith shot him in the back of the head and drove off. Murdaugh said the shot merely grazed him. He lost his vision briefly and became disoriented but survived. |
|Agent Kelly seemed incredulous. He repeatedly asked Murdaugh if he had paid Smith to shoot him. Murdaugh repeatedly said no. *“I’ll be honest,”* Kelly said, *“that doesn’t make any sense to me.”*  *“I understand,”* Murdaugh said. At the urging of his attorneys, Murdaugh also admitted he had abused opioids for the previous two decades. He said he paid Smith up to $60,000 a week, at times, to supply him drugs — usually with money Murdaugh admitted he had stolen. |
|State investigators later charged Murdaugh with secretly stealing nearly $9 million from legal settlements and fees owed to his clients, law partners and others who trusted him. Murdaugh said Smith acted as a sort of middleman, ferrying drugs and money between him and his supplier. But Murdaugh told Kelly he never interacted directly with the opioid suppliers and never owed them any money. That’s when Griffin, one of Murdaugh’s attorneys, jumped in and insinuated Smith might have been skimming money in the transactions. *“Ryan, that’s assuming that Curtis passed all the money along,”* he said. |
|Since’s Murdaugh’s July 2022 indictment, his defense attorneys have sought to shift blame for the slayings toward any other plausible suspects, most frequently Smith. Griffin has said at trial that Smith indeed was stealing money from Murdaugh’s drug transactions, possibly providing a motive for someone to harm Murdaugh or his family. Griffin has also touted the violent tendencies of the gang that supplied Murdaugh’s opioids, the Walterboro-based Cowboys. Kelly ended the interview by asking Murdaugh why he initially lied about the roadside shooting. Murdaugh said he lied to everyone — his family, his attorneys and the police. *“I don’t have a good reason,”* he said. *“I was in a bad, bad, bad place.”* |
|Kelly is one of the state’s final witnesses in Murdaugh’s trial. Prosecutors have called 60 people to the stand, including law enforcement officers, Murdaugh’s former colleagues and his family friends.  The Attorney General’s Office is expected to rest its case on Feb. 17. After that, Murdaugh’s defense team can call its own witnesses, including a parade of Murdaugh relatives and high-priced technical experts.|
|Murdaugh’s attorneys have already spent considerable time and effort cross-examining the state’s key witnesses. Earlier on Feb. 16, for example, defense attorney Harpootlian broke out an easel and a protractor and theatrically questioned the state’s crime scene expert about the trajectory of the shotgun blast that killed Paul. In an impromptu geometry lesson, Harpootlian questioned the expert, Orangeburg County sheriff’s Chief Deputy Kenneth Kinsey, on his opinion that Paul was shot at a sharp upward angle. Given there were no stippling or soot on Paul’s entry wound — either of which would indicate he was shot from close range — the shooter must have been more than 3 feet away, Harpootian and Kinsey agreed. Harpootlian’s demonstration showed that at that range, and at that angle, the gun would have been close to the ground. The shooter would have had to be very short — Murdaugh is over 6 feet tall — or crouching low to the ground and aiming upward, Harpootlian said. |
|Harpootlian asked why the shooter would do that. *“I can’t figure out why people do what they do,”* Kinsey said. Later on, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters asked if any of Harpootlian’s demonstration changed his opinion about how Paul was killed. *“It does not,”* Kinsey testified. Agent Kelly will be on the stand for cross-examination on Murdaugh’s roadside shooting when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. |

|New data exposes additional inconsistencies in Alex Murdaugh’s statements …|
| If Alex Murdaugh didn’t murder his wife and younger son on June 7, 2021 at his family’s hunting compound in Colleton County, South Carolina, his attorneys had better come up with something resembling answers to a suddenly coherent and compelling case presented by prosecutors in the office of attorney general Alan Wilson. According to a detailed summation of their case relying in part on recently obtained vehicular data, the disbarred Palmetto State attorney was in position to commit the crimes, had the motive to do so … and appears to have had access to both of the missing weapons used in the shootings. Both of those guns have been traced back to his family, incidentally. *“Family guns,”* as multiple witnesses have testified. More ominously, Murdaugh has now been caught in multiple lies related to his whereabouts immediately before and after these savage slayings – including several new lies exposed on Friday in detailed timeline testimony provided by special agent Peter Rudofski of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). |
|Will that be enough to convict him? We will find out soon … but prosectors, led by chief grand jury prosecutor Creighton Waters, have finally put together many of the discombobulate components of their case for jurors in an easily digestible, chronological fashion. The tool they used to do so? A detailed timeline presented by Rudolfski which incorporated cell phone extraction data, network location data, call data records, telemetry reports, license plate readers, cell phone application data and – most incriminatingly – updated vehicular data.
Prosecutors have been under pressure to deliver the goods in their case against Murdaugh after spending weeks weaving between various facets of his maze of alleged criminality – which this news outlet has dubbed the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|During Rudofski’s testimony, data provided just last week by General Motors pinpointed Murdaugh’s motions on the night of the murders – confirming multiple inconsistencies in his statements to law enforcement, family members and others in the community in the aftermath of the killings. The new data also reinforced testimony previously provided by Mushelle “Shelley” Smith – a caretaker for Murdaugh’s mother, Libby Murdaugh – about when Murdaugh arrived and left his parents’ property on the evening of June 7, 2021. Murdaugh claimed he was at his parents’ home for forty minutes – and according to Smith, attempted to get her to affirm this timeline after the fact. Smith testified Murdaugh was only at the Almeda residence for fifteen to twenty minutes – a timeline which has since been confirmed by the General Motors’ data. |
|Of additional concern for Murdaugh? The data showed his vehicle circling behind his parents’ home upon its arrival and parking near several outbuildings behind the home near a line of trees. *“The Suburban goes to outbuildings by the wood line,”* Rudofski testified. The confirmation of Smith’s timeline – and the evisceration of Murdaugh’s – could cause jurors to attribute more weight to her prior testimony. For example, Smith also told jurors she saw Murdaugh cradling a blue tarp/ rain jacket as he walked to the upstairs of his parents’ Almeda residence several days after the murders. A blue rain jacket was later found wadded up in an upstairs closet inside that home – coated in copious amounts of gunshot residue. |
