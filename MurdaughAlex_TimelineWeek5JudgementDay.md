| WALTERBORO — If Buster Murdaugh believes his father killed his mother and brother, he didn’t show it when he testified Feb. 21 before a Colleton County jury. Instead, Alex Murdaugh’s surviving son took the witness stand and offered the defense a boost. Over the course of two hours, Buster provided explanations for some of his father’s behavior in the hours and days after Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot to death on June 7, 2021. His answers helped diffuse some of the theories and suspicions prosecutors floated about his father over the double murder trial’s first four weeks. For example, prosecutors have alleged it was strange Murdaugh, 54, left the family’s hunting estate through its main driveway on the night of the slayings, rather than using another driveway by the dog kennels where Maggie and Paul were killed. Buster testified that wasn’t unusual: His family typically used the main driveway. Prosecutors have also implied Murdaugh parked in an unusual place during a late-night visit to his parents’ house on the evening of the slayings: behind the house, instead of the main carport. They have hinted the former attorney did so to hide evidence, including the still-unrecovered murder weapons, by the property’s treeline. Buster, however, testified visitors commonly parked there, especially at night, in order to use the home’s back door. |
|So it went for question after question as defense attorney Jim Griffin methodically walked Buster, 26, through many of the case’s loose ends and unanswered questions. Dressed in a dark suit and a crisp white shirt, Buster appeared stoic and distant on the witness stand, calmly and politely answering Griffin. He has maintained this demeanor throughout the trial, even as the uncles and aunts he sits with have regularly broken into tears. Murdaugh held a slight smile through much of his son’s testimony. He grew emotional only when Buster recalled the moment his father told him Maggie and Paul had been shot. Murdaugh patted Buster on the hip as he left the courtroom during a break. Buster didn’t say whether he thinks his father committed the crime, nor was he directly asked. But he and his relatives have sat a few rows behind Murdaugh each day of the trial, and several of them are on the defense’s list of potential witnesses.|
|Buster’s testimony countered one key aspect of the state’s theory in particular: that Murdaugh snuck off to his parents’ house in the days after the slayings to dispose of the murder weapons for good. One of the state’s star witnesses, a caregiver for Murdaugh’s mother, testified she saw Murdaugh coming and going from his parents’ property in Almeda early one morning about a week after Maggie and Paul were killed at the family’s Colleton County hunting estate. Murdaugh also centered the home at one point carrying something blue and taking it upstairs, Shelley Smith testified.|
|Prosecutors believe that blue object was a rain jacket that was covered in gunshot residue on the inside. They allege Murdaugh had wrapped at least one of the murder weapons — a 12-gauge shotgun used to kill 22-year-old Paul and a .300 Blackout military-style rifle used to kill Maggie, 52 — within the coat. Prosecutors also have hinted that they believe Murdaugh used the early morning visit to his parents’ house to retrieve and dispose of the guns for good. |
|But under questioning from Griffin, Buster said he spent 10 straight days with his father after the killings, staying together at family members’ homes around the state. *“Do you ever remember your dad disappearing for periods of time?”* Griffin asked. *“No, sir,”* Buster replied. *“Were you physically close to him most all the time?”* Griffin asked. *“Yes, sir,”* Buster said. |
|Another controversial piece of evidence Buster testified about was the supposed confession investigators say Alex gave during a June 10, 2021, interview with State Law Enforcement Division agents. An investigator testified he heard Murdaugh say *“I did him so bad”* while breaking into hysterics, apparently admitting to killing Paul. But investigators never followed up on the alleged admission or even wrote it in their notes. Murdaugh’s attorneys contend an audio recording of the interview clearly shows Murdaugh said, *“They did him so bad,”* referring to Paul’s killer. On the witness stand Feb. 21, Buster agreed. He said his father repeated, *“They did him so bad,”* over and over in the hours and days after the slayings, referring to the grisly shotgun blasts that killed Paul. |
|Griffin also questioned Buster about his father’s opioid addiction. Buster said the family was aware of it for years. Murdaugh had entered treatment for drug abuse after Christmas in 2018, Buster recalled, and the family thought he had kicked it. But they were wrong, and Paul and Maggie occasionally confronted Murdaugh when they found pills he shouldn’t have been taking, Buster said. Buster testified his father was always apologetic during those confrontations, which remained civil. *“Was there any violence in the family?”* Griffin asked. *“No, sir,”* Buster said. In the first full day of presenting their own case, the defense sought to cast doubt on the story prosecutors laid out to jurors over four weeks about how and why Maggie and Paul were shot. |
|The defense began offering their own narrative by calling a mechanical engineer, Mike Sutton, to discuss his theory of where the shooter was standing based on where stray bullets landed. Bullets pierced a quail cage and dog house near where Maggie was found dead, for instance. Based on State Law Enforcement Division agents’ measurements of how those structures were hit and the location where bullet casings were found, Sutton testified the rifle would have been fired relatively low to the ground. Sutton testified that makes it implausible Murdaugh, who stands 6-foot-4, could have been the triggerman. He estimated the shooter was no taller than 5-foot-4. *“It’s very unlikely that he fired that shot,”* Sutton said.|
|On cross-examination, prosecutor David Fernandez took aim at Sutton’s credibility. Though the state had no objection to Sutton being admitted as an expert witness, Fernandez led Sutton through a battery of questions about his lack of training and expertise in firearms, shooting incident reconstruction and pathology. Fernandez was quick to elicit testimony that Murdaugh paid Sutton’s company $350 an hour for its work on his case, and that Sutton had already worked more than 40 hours. Fernandez suggested Sutton’s opinions were mere guesswork, not science. He repeatedly mocked the engineer’s three-dimensional model of Maggie’s shooting, which depicted the shooter as an anonymous, short male figure. Fernandez repeatedly referred to it as a 12-year-old child before defense attorney Dick Harpootlian objected and Judge Clifton Newman put a stop to it. Murdaugh’s team will continue to call witnesses when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 22. |

|Surviving son of Alex Murdaugh pokes holes in prosecution’s case …|
|The surviving son of disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh took the stand on Tuesday morning – the first substantive witness called by attorneys who are defending his father on murder charges.|
|Murdaugh is the scion of an influential Lowcountry legal dynasty – a man who once led the Palmetto State’s powerful trial lawyers’ association. Today, he sits at the epicenter of a maze of alleged criminality known as the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga. Murdaugh stands accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and is currently standing trial in Walterboro – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his famous family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century. |
|Buster Murdaugh, 26, testified extensively to the Murdaugh family’s dynamics – including his father’s loving relationship with him, his brother, his mother and her parents, Terry Branstetter and Kennedy Branstetter. More substantively, Murdaugh challenged prosecutors’ interpretation of recently obtained vehicular data which showed his father’s Suburban circling behind his grandparents’ home in Almeda, S.C. upon its arrival shortly after the murders – parking near several outbuildings near a line of trees.|
| *“The Suburban goes to outbuildings by the wood line,”* special agent Peter Rudofski of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) testified. According to Buster Murdaugh, the location of the Suburban behind his grandparents’ residence was consistent with someone accessing the home from the rear entrance. *“Was it common to go in the back door?”* attorney Jim Griffin asked Murdaugh. *“Yes sir,”* he responded. This was one of many key components of the prosecution’s case addressed during Murdaugh’s testimony. |
|Buster Murdaugh also testified his father’s demeanor was *“completely normal”* when he called him after 9:10 p.m. EDT – approximately twenty minutes after the murders took place – saying his tone was *“no different”* than it was on any of the previous calls he had exchanged with him earlier in the day. Buster Murdaugh also lent support to key points in the defense’s narrative – saying his father did not always carry his phone with him on the Moselle property and often showered and changed clothes in the evenings after dinner. Perhaps most significantly, Murdaugh challenged the prosecution’s assertion that his father was wearing a sea foam-colored Columbia brand shirt in the hours leading up to the murders. *“It doesn’t look like a Columbia shirt,”* Murdaugh testified, adding he believed the shirt was *“blue.”* |
|In addition to debunking several prosecutorial points, Buster Murdaugh provided new insight into his father’s widely cited opioid addiction, referring to a 2018 stint Alex Murdaugh allegedly spent in a detoxification facility. He further testified to learning about his mother and brother discovering pills belonging to his father in 2021 – but indicated he assumed Alex Murdaugh had beaten his addiction. |
|On the night of the murders, Buster Murdaugh – who was in Rock Hill, S.C. with his girlfriend at the time – testified to learning of the savage slayings via a phone call with his father at approximately 10:47 p.m. EDT. *“He asked me if I was sitting down – then he told me my mother and brother had been shot,”* Murdaugh testified. Upon arriving at Moselle hours later, Buster Murdaugh testified his father was *“destroyed”* and could hardly speak. In the days after the killings, Alex Murdaugh offered to pay for private security for Buster – but his son declined the offer, saying he valued his privacy and *“didn’t want to carry a gun.”* |
|From the very beginning, Buster Murdaugh has been among the most elusive figures in the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga – although the limited commentary he previously provided pointed to him being a potentially hostile witness for the defense. That is clearly not how things played out on Tuesday … |

| **[Dick Harpootlian’s Gun Joke Draws Jeers](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/22/dick-harpootlians-gun-joke-draws-jeers/)** |
|Alex Murdaugh’s attorney catching heat …|
|A light-hearted moment inside the courtroom turned into a cancel campaign on social media after South Carolina senator Dick Harpootlian – the lead attorney for disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh – made what many believed was an inappropriate joke during his client’s double homicide trial on Tuesday. Even worse? Harpootlian’s attempt at humor happened as he was holding a modified assault rifle similar to the one his client allegedly used in the commission of this graphic crime. Was the joke really cancel-worthy, though? Or is Harpootlian being unfairly castigated?|
|To me, the dust-up was the latest demonstration of chasm of perspective that exists between actually being inside the courtroom as events unfold and merely following them on television or social media. Reaction to the joke also reinforced the deep-seated biases prevalent among so many “covering” this trial … a rigid inflexibility which often prohibits people from assessing developments rationally.|
|To be clear: Based on everything I have seen thus far, I believe Murdaugh is guilty as sin of committing these murders. So does 92 percent of my audience, according to the latest polls. But does my firmly held belief in Murdaugh’s guilt mean I should refuse to consider the case brought by his lawyers? Or close my mind completely to all other possibilities? Does it compel me to view everything that happens in his trial – and within the broader ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga – as conforming to my current beliefs? Does it demand that I surrender all perspective – all intellectual independence and critical thinking – and react to anything emanating from Murdaugh’s attorneys with perpetual, pearl-clutching indignation? That may be how some people choose to cover these proceedings … but not me. |
|Anyway, Tuesday’s drama began shortly after 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday as Harpootlian was conducting his direct examination of Mike Sutton – a forensic engineer retained on behalf of Murdaugh’s defense. Personally, I did not find Sutton to be an especially credible witness – and I believe assistant attorney general David Fernandez did an admirable job of challenging his credibility (and conclusions) via his aggressive cross-examination. |
During his direct examination, though, Harpootlian attempted to demonstrate for jurors a key component of the defense’s theory of the shooting – namely that someone who stands as tall as Alex Murdaugh could not possibly have fired the fatal shots. |
|In attempting to find a good location within the courtroom to depict the shooter’s stance, Harpootlian at one point stood adjacent to the witness stand with the muzzle of the rifle he was holding pointed squarely at the prosecution table (and the media seated just behind them). *“Tempting,”* he joked as he brandished the weapon. As you can hear on the clip, Harpootlian’s remark was greeted with laughter from those in the courtroom.|
|There were no groans, no gasps, no moans … just laughter. Prosecutors laughed. Press laughed. Jurors laughed. Hell, I laughed … and the gun Harpootlian was holding was pointed in the general direction of where I was sitting.|
|As the laughter subsided, Harpootlian cited his frustration at being unable to find spot inside the cramped courtroom where “I’m not pointing this at somebody.” He eventually settled on a spot to the right of the jury facing the rear of the courtroom with the muzzle of the gun facing a door. Finally in position, he proceeded with his underwhelming, unconvincing reenactment of the shooter’s stance … one which did not appear to move the needle for his client in any meaningful way.|
|Outside the courtroom, though, the cancel mob was in full swing. And not just at Harpootlian. Hours later, I took inordinate amounts of grief for tweeting that I found his joke funny … which it was. Seriously … I haven’t seen this level of indignation since the good people of Walterboro decided to (gasp) recruit food trucks to help feed all the people coming to their town for this trial. The horror, right? As I noted in that article, *“when you are indignant about everything, your indignation means nothing.”* I am not saying it is wrong to be offended by Harpootlian’s comment. That’s a perfectly valid response – one which was obviously shared by a great many people. I’m just saying I wasn’t offended by it – nor, apparently, was anyone inside the courtroom. |

|WALTERBORO — For about an hour, Mark Ball seemed like a star witness for the defense at Alex Murdaugh’s heavily watched double-murder trial. Murdaugh’s former law partner testified Feb. 22 about his friend’s distress in the hours after the Hampton lawyer’s wife, Maggie, and son Paul were shot to death. Ball also helped Murdaugh’s attorneys score points in their quest to cast the ensuing homicide investigation as sloppy and inept. He testified about seeing first responders walk haphazardly through the crime scene on the evening of June 7, 2021. He said he was instructed to go to Murdaugh’s house that night, even though investigators hadn’t yet searched it for evidence. Ball found a huge chunk of Paul’s skull that state investigators didn’t bother collecting as evidence when he visited the Murdaughs’ estate the next day. But an hour later, Ball didn’t sound like a defense witness at all. Instead, he was fuming as he explained the financial wreckage Murdaugh, 54, left as he secretly stole millions from his legal clients, law partners and others who trusted him. He said he didn’t think he truly knew his longtime partner. *“The person I thought I knew loved his family, or appeared to love his family,”* Ball said, recounting memories of how Murdaugh answered their every call. *“I’m not sure I know that person.”* Ball’s testimony exemplified a challenge both prosecutors and Murdaugh’s defense team have faced in calling witnesses throughout the trial’s first five weeks.|
|Murdaugh’s relatives, friends and colleagues have proven to be double-edged swords on the witness stand. They can help the defense by testifying about Murdaugh’s devotion to his family and his love for the two victims in this case, his wife, Maggie, 52, and son Paul, 22. But they can also help prosecutors by detailing how Murdaugh betrayed them and everyone else in his orbit, destroying his family’s century-old Lowcountry legacy in the process. Several also have described behavior they considered suspicious from Murdaugh in the aftermaths of the slayings, including that he rarely — if ever — discussed who might have killed Maggie and Paul. The same will likely be true of Murdaugh himself, who could take the witness stand in his own defense as early as Feb. 23. Murdaugh’s attorneys have spent the past several days weighing the potential risks and rewards of putting him on the stand before they rest their case.|
|Jim Griffin, one of Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, indicated in court Feb. 22 that his client would certainly testify if Judge Clifton Newman agreed to prevent prosecutors from asking Murdaugh incriminating questions about his alleged financial crimes. In addition to murder charges he is on trial for currently, Murdaugh faces nearly 100 other counts related to the alleged financial misdeeds.  State prosecutors pushed back, and Newman sided with them, saying such a blanket order protecting a defendant from critical cross-examination would be unprecedented. Griffin then asked if Murdaugh could testify about the slayings while still asserting his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions about his alleged financial crimes. Newman did not give a definitive answer. That means the defense will have to decide without knowing what Murdaugh might have to answer for. |
|Ball took the stand shortly thereafter. He said he’d known Murdaugh for 34 years and worked with him for two decades at the prestigious Hampton law firm Murdaugh’s great-grandfather founded in 1910. Their families were close. Like some previous witnesses, Ball was animated in part by his sense of feeling betrayed by Murdaugh, a man he’d long worked with and counted as a friend. He testified Murdaugh abused the familial bond employees of the law firm shared.|
|State prosecutors and Murdaugh’s defense attorneys handled Ball like a live grenade, trying to pose questions that pointed him in the right direction without accidentally letting him detonate in their faces. It didn’t always work, as Ball pushed back against both sides’ questions at times. He didn’t seem to be as firmly in either camp as many of the dozens of witnesses who have testified throughout the trial. Under questioning from Griffin, Ball testified a slew of people continued driving into the Murdaughs’ spacious Colleton County hunting property on the night of the slayings. Deputies ignored his recommendations to block off the scene, Ball said. He described how law enforcement officers had failed to preserve aspects of the scene, even letting rainwater spill from the roof of the dog kennels onto Paul’s bloody body, where he had been felled by two shotgun blasts. *It’s a crime scene. You don’t want water dripping all over the place,”* Ball said. *“But more importantly, I thought it was pretty disrespectful. Paul was a good young man. Quite frankly, it just pissed me off.”* Ball also said it was odd that agents with the State Law Enforcement Division allowed the Murdaugh family and their friends to go up to their house that night, entering the residence even before SLED agents could search and clear it. SLED has since been criticized for failing to conduct a thorough search of the home until months later. *“Where does the crime scene start and stop?”* Ball asked.|
|But on cross-examination, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters had Ball testify about the lies Murdaugh told him. Ball said Murdaugh told him *“at least three times”* that he never went down to the hunting estate’s dog kennels until discovering Maggie and Paul’s bodies there later that night. A video later discovered on Paul’s phone places Murdaugh with Maggie and Paul at the kennels just minutes before investigators believe the shootings began. Ball also testified that Murdaugh was an *“obnoxious user”* of his cellphone who would step out of meetings and depositions to take calls from his relatives. That testimony helped bolster prosecutors’ theory that Murdaugh planned out the slayings in advance, taking care to leave his phone at home so it wouldn’t track him to the kennels that evening. Murdaugh’s phone recorded no steps or other activity for nearly an hour while he was at the kennels, according to evidence presented in the case. *“It would be unusual for Alex to go anywhere without his phone,”* Ball said. Ball testified about how he and his coworkers uncovered evidence that Murdaugh had spent the past decade stealing from his clients and the law firm. Ball said he had to call many of those clients, tell them what Murdaugh had done and work to fix it. The firm ultimately dissolved and reformed under a new name - Parker Law Group - because of the tarnish Murdaugh put on it. The firm and its partners had to pay back millions of dollars to Murdaugh’s victims. *“I’m mad as hell,” Ball said. “You just don’t know how mad I am.”* Such was Ball’s anger that when he learned Murdaugh had been shot in the head on Sept. 4, 2021, a day after the law firm forced him to resign, his first thought was, *“Don’t tell me that jackass killed himself.”* It turned out Murdaugh had survived. He later confessed to staging his own shooting in a failed attempt to die and leave behind a hefty life insurance payout to his remaining son Buster. Ball said he wouldn’t even believe Murdaugh had a life insurance policy unless he saw a copy of it. Waters drew a line between the September 2021 shooting and the slayings of Maggie and Paul. Prosecutors believe Murdaugh killed them to engender sympathy for himself and buy time to cover up his financial wrongdoings. *“And just when accountability is going to happen again, the defendant manufactures himself being a victim, correct?”* Waters asked. *“That’s what it turned out to be,”* Ball said.|

| **[Murdaugh Trial: Arrest Made In Courthouse Bomb Threat](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/22/murdaugh-trial-arrest-made-in-courthouse-bomb-threat/)** |
|Inmate charged …|
|Local and state authorities have identified the individual they say is responsible for calling in a bomb threat to the Colleton County courthouse in Walterboro, South Carolina two weeks ago. The bomb threat briefly delayed the double homicide trial of disbarred Palmetto State attorney Alex Murdaugh – a case which has drawn international attention (and which is the focus of a newly launched Netflix documentary). As this news outlet reported at the time, presiding judge Clifton Newman ordered the evacuation of the building at 12:23 p.m. EST on February 8, 2023 during the testimony of special agent Brian Hudak of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Hudak – a computer crimes technician – had just been called to the stand to testify on behalf of the state when Newman called for the building to be cleared. *“Ladies and gentlemen we have to evacuate the building at this time,”* Newman announced calmly. *“So we will be in recess until we discover what’s going on.”* |
|The bomb threat – which was determined to have been unfounded – delayed proceedings until shortly after 3:00 p.m. EST. According to a news release from the Colleton County sheriff’s office, an *“unidentified male caller”* telephoned the courthouse’s main switchboard at some point after noon and claimed there was a *“bomb in the judge’s chamber.”* As the courthouse was being cleared, SLED agents and Colleton sheriff’s detectives *“began working to identify the caller”* – and were able to trace the *“target phone”* to the Ridgeland Correctional Institute in Jasper County. There, officers of the S.C. Department of Corrections (SCDC) located a cellular device in the possession of an inmate named Joey Dean Coleman. *“An initial forensic examination of the phone confirmed the components were a match to the device used to call in the bomb threat to the courthouse,”* the Colleton County release confirmed. |
|Was there any connection between Coleman and the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century?’ *“At this time, no direct connection has been identified between Joey Coleman and Alex Murdaugh or the Murdaugh trial,”* the Colleton County statement noted. Colleton sheriff’s detectives – who are leading the investigation – have obtained a felony arrest warrant for Coleman for the phone call threat. Coleman, 32, was moved to Ridgeland on January 24, 2023 – the day after the trial began. He was transferred on February 8, 2023 – the day of the bomb threat – to a secure facility at the Broad River Correctional Facility just north of Columbia, S.C. At the time of the threat, he was approximately four years into a lengthy sentence on kidnapping, assault, armed robbery and weapons charges. Coleman was not eligible for parole, and had a projected release date of October 7, 2045. |

|Moment of “truth?”|
|Against the advice of his attorneys – who were reportedly at the Colleton County detention center late Wednesday evening pleading their case – disbarred South Carolina lawyer Alex Murdaugh has reportedly decided to take the stand in his own defense this week. Murdaugh’s testimony could come as early as 9:30 a.m. EST today (February 23, 2023), multiple sources familiar with the situation have confirmed to this news outlet. News of Murdaugh’s decision was reported early Thursday morning by Avery Wilks of The (Charleston, S.C.) Post and Courier and John Monk of The (Columbia, S.C.) State newspaper. It was also previously reported over a week ago by reporters Andrew Davis of WSAV TV-3 (NBC – Savannah) and Riley Benson of WCBD TV-2 (NBC – Charleston, S.C.). As previously reported, there will be no initial limits on what prosecutors will be allowed to ask Murdaugh on cross-examination. Yesterday, S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman rejected a motion from defense attorneys seeking to establish “parameters” for the waiver of Murdaugh’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. |
| *“I am not going to issue an order in advance limiting the scope of his testimony,”* Newman said. According to my sources, this motion was an effort by Murdaugh’s attorneys – Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin – to show their client the dangers of taking the stand. Harpootlian and Griffin also reportedly called numerous high-profile trial lawyers in the Palmetto State eliciting their counsel – information which they proceeded to pass along to their client. To a person, these attorneys all advised against Murdaugh testifying. None of it appears to have worked … |
|If Murdaugh moves forward with testifying, what awaits him on cross-examination would be nothing short of *“medieval”* and would likely cover *“significant new ground,”* according to a well-placed prosecutorial source. Specifically, extensive evidence debunking the perception of Murdaugh as a *“loving family man”* is expected to be introduced. This is a developing story … please check back for updates. |

|WALTERBORO — Twenty-three days into his nationally televised double murder trial and 20 months after his wife and son were brutally killed, Alex Murdaugh finally broke his silence. He pleaded with 12 jurors to trust him, despite his long history of deceit. Yes, he had lied to investigators, his family and his friends about where he was the night Maggie and Paul died, the former attorney admitted on the witness stand Feb. 23. And yes, he conceded, he had lied to his clients about the millions he stole from them. But Murdaugh insisted he had not gunned down his wife and son at the family’s Colleton County hunting estate. *“I did not kill Maggie, and I did not kill Paul. I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul,”* Murdaugh, 54, testified. *“Ever. Under any circumstances.”* |
|Against the advice of his attorneys, the disbarred Hampton lawyer took the stand in his own defense during the fifth week of a high-profile trial that has captivated the country’s attention. What followed was nearly three hours of riveting testimony in which Murdaugh’s defense attorneys attempted to humanize their client, who often sobbed and rocked in his chair as he spoke glowingly of his slain wife and son. Murdaugh looked intently at jurors as he detailed his version of what happened on June 7, 2021. He publicly apologized and admitted for the first time that he had misled investigators about being at the crime scene shortly before his family was fatally shot.|
|Then came nearly two hours of cross-examination. Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters sought to demolish what remains of Murdaugh’s credibility, casting him as a master manipulator who lied to legal clients’ faces while secretly stealing their money to finance his lavish lifestyle. The Murdaughs owned a massive hunting estate, a house at Edisto Beach, late-model cars and an extensive gun collection. Murdaugh readily admitted to the thefts, hoping to put a quick end to the questioning. But Waters wouldn’t relent. He reminded the defendant of several clients he betrayed and asked him to recall specific details of their cases for the jury. The detailed questioning puts Murdaugh in a bind, as every answer potentially provided ammunition for prosecutors to use against him in future trials. He still faces nearly 100 criminal financial charges that allege he stole nearly $9 million. *“I misled them. And I lied to them. And I took their money — a number of times,”* Murdaugh said before Judge Clifton Newman stepped in and ended court for the day. |
|Waters will continue his cross-examination when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 24.|
|Murdaugh’s choice to take the stand was his alone, and his attorneys made clear they did not support it. When Newman asked whether Murdaugh needed to discuss the decision further with his defense team, the ginger-haired ex-attorney said no. *“I don’t need to talk to them anymore,”* Murdaugh declared. *“I am going to testify. I want to testify.”* |
|The most obvious goal for Murdaugh’s testimony was to explain what no other witness possibly could: why he repeatedly lied to investigators, his friends and his relatives about not seeing Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, at the property’s kennels before they were killed. Murdaugh initially said he ate dinner with them shortly after 8 p.m. and then fell asleep on the couch. He said he left the property about an hour later to visit his mother. Murdaugh returned home around 10:06 p.m. and discovered the dead bodies of his wife and son by the kennels. Murdaugh repeatedly insisted to state agents he didn’t go down to the kennels that evening, starting with an interview hours after the killings. But investigators later found a video on his son’s phone that proved Murdaugh was there as late as 8:45 p.m. — four minutes before prosecutors believe they were killed. Prosecutors have held up that lie throughout the trial as evidence of Murdaugh’s guilt. Defense attorney Jim Griffin addressed it quickly Feb. 23 while questioning his client on the stand. Murdaugh admitted he lied, saying his two-decade opioid addiction had made him paranoid and distrustful of the state agents who arrived on scene to investigate the slayings. A county sheriff’s deputy had swabbed his hands for a gunshot residue test. Within hours, investigators were asking about his relationships with Maggie and Paul. *“I wasn’t thinking clearly,”* Murdaugh told jurors. *“I don’t think I was capable of reason. And I lied about being down there. And I’m so sorry that I did.”* |
|After that, Murdaugh said he thought he had to keep lying to avoid arousing suspicion. He parroted the same story to friends and family — and again state investigators in interviews conducted June 10 and Aug. 11, 2021. *“Oh, what a tangled web we weave,”* Murdaugh said, quoting Sir Walter Scott. *“Once I told the lie and I told my family, I had to keep lying.”* Griffin walked Murdaugh through questions aimed at countering some of the key points prosecutors landed over the first four first weeks of the trial. |
| Murdaugh, dressed in a blue blazer and crisp white shirt, angled his body toward the jury box as he answered, trying to connect with the 12 people who will decide his fate.|
|Murdaugh first began crying when he apologized to his family — most of all his late wife and son. As he described Maggie and Paul, Murdaugh’s family became emotional, too, but they did not appear to react outwardly to his repeated admissions. At one point, his sister, Lynn, dabbed tears as Alex described Paul as *“an absolute delight.”* His remaining son, Buster, 26, wiped his eyes as his father described his mother’s devotion to the family. Jurors appeared to closely follow Murdaugh’s testimony throughout the morning, though they settled in as his time on the stand stretched into hours. As Griffin played his 911 call reporting the killings, some jurors seemed to watch Murdaugh intently as he chugged water, rocked his head and took several deep breaths. Murdaugh’s voice cracked describing what he saw when he came to the kennels. *“I saw what y’all have seen pictures of,”* Murdaugh said, his voice breaking as it had in police interviews more than a year earlier. His face turned red. He looked straight down and paused for several seconds. Then he added, in a hoarse whisper: *“So bad.”* He continued to sob and rock back and forth intermittently, mucus trailing from his nose. During a break in his testimony, he dabbed tears and shook his head. During the afternoon cross-examination, Waters tried to blunt the impact of Murdaugh’s testimony by reminding jurors of his history of manipulating and betraying everyone in his orbit. Waters accused Murdaugh several times of rehearsing and acting out his testimony, including when he repeatedly referred to his son Paul by a nickname — “PawPaw” — that Waters said investigators had never heard before. And he pointed out that Murdaugh reiterated the same answers when describing his financial misdeeds, admitting to misleading clients, lying to them and taking money that wasn’t his. *“How many times did you practice that answer before your testimony today?”* Waters asked. *“I’ve never practiced that answer,”* Murdaugh said.|
|Even before Murdaugh took the stand, his defense team saw this coming. Griffin and fellow defense attorney Dick Harpootlian told Newman they worried putting Murdaugh on the witness stand would give prosecutors total freedom to batter their client with questions about his alleged decade-long financial crime spree. Getting answers to those questions, of course, could help prosecutors secure convictions on the financial charges pending against Murdaugh.|
|Harpootlian asked Newman to prevent prosecutors from asking Murdaugh questions about his alleged financial crimes, saying otherwise prosecutors would embark on a *“character assassination”* of his client to win a conviction. *“This is a Bernie Madoff trial, not a murder trial,”* said Harpootlian, referring to the late New York financier who defrauded clients of nearly $65 billion in the largest Ponzi scheme in history. Newman declined. The defense’s concerns proved to be founded. Waters peppered Murdaugh with questions about his dealings with clients he had swindled. And he drew attention to the ways in which Murdaugh allegedly used his position as a volunteer assistant solicitor to curry favor in the community. Murdaugh acknowledged he used his position with the solicitor’s office to get blue lights installed in his car, and he often carried a badge from the office, sometimes placing it conspicuously in his car in case he was pulled over. He noted it had a *“warming effect”* on law enforcement officers. He said he only worked on five criminal trials over more than two decades.|
|Over two hours of back-and-forth, Waters asked just one question about the slayings. He wanted to know if the main reason Murdaugh was testifying was to explain his months-long lie to investigators about his alibi. *“I think all of my testimony is important, Mr. Waters,”* Murdaugh said.|
| **[‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial: Alex Murdaugh Takes The Stand](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/23/murdaugh-murders-trial-alex-murdaugh-takes-the-stand/)** |
|It’s all on the line in South Carolina’s ‘Trial of the Century.’|
|Against the advice of his attorneys, disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh took the stand in his double homicide trial on Thursday, laying out his (latest) narrative regarding the savage slayings of his wife and youngest son. As Murdaugh prepared to testify, his attorney Jim Griffin announced *“the defendant Richard Alex Murdaugh wishes to testify.”* At no time did he say the defense had *“called”* Murdaugh to the stand.|
|That’s a key distinction …|
|As this news outlet previously reported, Murdaugh’s attorneys were said to have been at the Colleton County detention center late Wednesday evening pleading their case with their client – to no avail.|
| Prior to Murdaugh testifying, S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman warned him outside the presence of the jury that he could be *“examined and cross-examined on any relevant issue in this case”* – noting his decision to take the stand should be *“freely, voluntarily and intelligently made.”* *“Do you understand?”* Newman asked Murdaugh. |
| *“Yes sir,”* the defendant responded.|
|Murdaugh is the scion of an influential Lowcountry legal dynasty – a man who once led the Palmetto State’s powerful trial lawyers’ lobby. Today, he sits at the epicenter of a maze of alleged criminality known as the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|In addition to a host of other alleged crimes, Murdaugh stands accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and is currently standing trial in Walterboro – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his famous family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century. Just moments before he testified, this news outlet was granted access to a closed circuit camera feed showing Murdaugh sitting alone in his holding cell – his navy blue blazer folded neatly on a concrete riser next to him. Murdaugh appeared to be looking over a white legal pad as he waited to be escorted into the courtroom. At one point, Murdaugh dropped a pen and fumbled to pick it up. At other points, he appeared to be folding his hands and leaning forward with his head bowed – nodding his head furiously as though he were praying. It was a moment of absolute isolation – a calm before the coming cacophony in court.|
|Standing before the judge moments later, Murdaugh was asked whether he wanted to consult with his attorneys before making his final decision. *“No sir, I don’t need to talk to them anymore,”* he said. The apparent discord between Murdaugh and his counselors resurfaced just before he took the stand at around 10:00 a.m. EST – with Newman asking attorneys for the accused killer whether they needed additional time to confer with their client. *“I don’t need any more time,”* Murdaugh whispered to his lead attorney, Dick Harpootlian. |
| *“He hurt my feelings,”* Harpootlian joked. *“He said he doesn’t need to talk to me.”* |
|When he finally took the stand, Murdaugh was asked point blank by Griffin whether he murdered his wife and son. In fact, Griffin brandished one of the shotguns entered into evidence and asked Murdaugh whether he used a gun like it to *“blow his son’s brains out.”* |
| *“No I did not,”* Murdaugh responded. *“Mr. Griffin I didn’t shoot my wife or my son anytime. Ever.”* During his testimony, Murdaugh did admit to a host of financial crimes – including stealing millions of dollars from his former clients. He also waxed extensively, eloquently and tearfully about his late wife and son – rolling out pet names he used for them. *“Paw Paw was just the brightest, most inquisitive young man,”* Murdaugh said, referring to his late son Paul Murdaugh. *“He was a man’s man. He was a hundred percent country boy.”* *“He was such a special boy,”* Murdaugh said. *“He cared about people. He was fiercely – fiercely loyal. He was so misrepresented by the media.”* |
|Murdaugh referred to his son as being the sort of person who would “take his friends on a boat in the sunset” – an odd reference considering Paul Murdaugh was facing felony boating under the influence charges at the time of his death. Those criminal charges – and a civil case which has figured prominently in these proceedings – were both tied to a February 24, 2019 crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C.|
|The boat crash figured prominently in lead prosecutor Creighton Waters‘ cross-examination of Murdaugh – notably the fact the defendant was under investigation for allegedly obstructing justice in the aftermath of that crash. Murdaugh denied the alleged obstruction of justice, saying he *“never told anyone”* involved in the boat crash to refrain from cooperating with law enforcement. Waters pressed Murdaugh on his use of a solicitor’s badge – two badges, actually – during his visits to a local hospital to speak with victims following the boat crash. *“I guess I’m not being charged with that,”* Murdaugh said, referring to the obstruction allegations as *“totally false”* and *“totally baseless.”* |
|Murdaugh did confess to enough financial crimes on Thursday to guarantee he will spend most – if not all – of the remainder of his natural life in prison. However, he frequently professed ignorance when Waters sought to pin him down on the specifics of those crimes – including meetings with clients where he was, according to the prosecutor, *“looking someone in the eye and convincing them as he was stealing their money.”* *“You just said you remember a lot of them – I’m asking you to tell me just one of them,”* Waters said. *“Just one specific one, Mr. Murdaugh.”* |
|Murdaugh clearly did not want to get into those details, choosing instead to repeatedly return to a regurgitative litany – ‘I lied, I stole, I did wrong’ – that drew audible groans from the gallery each time he invoked it. Waters mocked Murdaugh at one point for his seemingly rehearsed responses saying *“you can just write that down on a piece of paper and hold it up.”* *“How many times have you practiced that answer?”* he added. *“You keep using it.”* |
|Murdaugh eventually offered up a revealing admission regarding the financial crimes, though. *“One of the saddest parts of this whole thing is they’re people I still care about and I did them this way,”* he said. *“I did a lot of damage and wreaked a lot of havoc.”* |
| *“You did a lot of damage and wreaked a lot of havoc,”* Waters echoed. *“That’s for sure.”* One question that remains elusive in all these admissions: Where did all the money go? *“I know I was making a bunch of money,”* Murdaugh acknowledged at one point during his testimony. *“I know I was spending a bunch of money on pills.”* |
|Yes … but even the most severe opioid habit couldn’t come close to accounting for the massive sums he was stealing from clients on top of his “legitimate” income as an attorney. The math simply doesn’t add up. Speaking of his opioid addiction, Murdaugh conveniently cited it as the reason he lied to police on multiple occasions about his whereabouts in the minutes leading up to the murders (a.k.a. his shredded alibi). *“On June 7, I wasn’t thinking clearly,”* Murdaugh said. *“As my addiction evolved over time I became more (prone to) paranoid thinking.”* Murdaugh also claimed to have been motivated by a “distrust” of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) – even though he later took credit for giving the agency *“carte blanche”* to search his properties and to question him and other witnesses in the aftermath of the killings. *“All of my partners were telling me don’t talk to anyone,”* Murdaugh said. *“I’m sitting in a police car and (senior SLED special agent) David Owen is asking me all of these questions. All of those things coupled together with my distrust of SLED caused me to have paranoid thoughts.”* *“I lied about being down there,”* Murdaugh continued. *“And I’m so sorry that I did. I’m sorry to my son Buster. Most of all I’m sorry to Mags and Paul. I would never do anything intentionally to hurt either one of them. Ever. Ever.” Murdaugh stated that *“once I lied I continued to lie.”* |
|Asked to explain his dishonesty, he quoted Sir Walter Scott‘s famous line: *“What a tangled web we weave.”* *“Once I told a lie … I had to keep lying,”* Murdaugh said.|
|Has he stopped lying, though?|
|Jurors appeared thoroughly unimpressed by Murdaugh’s explanation for his repeated lies to law enforcement, family members and his law partners – and for much of his testimony they seemed to be viewing him with considerable skepticism. The mood seemed to shift as the day wore on, though, especially when Murdaugh invoked the controversy over his bloody (or rather not bloody) shirt – which investigators initially claimed had traces of high-velocity impact spatter. *“Until my lawyers proved that this blood spatter that they said I had on my shirt – from my wife and my son – was a lie, all of a sudden my clothes became an issue,” he said, adding that “there was no blood spatter on me.”*
|That comment certainly seemed to pique the jury’s interest … |
|Judge Newman called an abrupt halt to Murdaugh’s cross-examination shortly after 5:30 p.m. EST – announcing that court would adjourn until 9:30 a.m. EST the following morning. Murdaugh will return to the stand when court reconvenes, with Waters expected to ramp up his cross-examination. |

|WALTERBORO — Alex Murdaugh lied *“easily and convincingly”* to his family, friends, legal clients and law partners for more than a decade as he stole millions of dollars to finance his lavish lifestyle and raging opioid addiction, state prosecutor Creighton Waters asserted Feb. 24. And now, near the end of Murdaugh’s double murder trial, Waters tried to convince a Colleton County jury that the former Hampton lawyer is peddling another lie with new testimony that he left his wife and son just minutes before they were shot to death by an unknown assailant. *“The second that you’re confronted with facts that you can’t deny, you immediately come up with a new lie,”* Waters challenged Murdaugh during a cross-examination that stretched two days. *“Isn’t that correct?”* |
| *“Mr. Waters, as we have established, I have lied many times,”* Murdaugh responded. But, he added, he disagreed with the prosecutor’s premise *“that that was what I did all the time.”* |
| Crowds at Colleton County’s historic courthouse have grown larger throughout the five-week trial, reaching a crescendo Feb. 24 as Murdaugh prepared to take the witness stand for a second day. Lines snaked out from the courthouse doors early in the morning; some onlookers hoping to get in arrived at 4:30 a.m., only to find they weren’t the first there. At times, the packed gallery disrupted the proceedings with laughter, prompting the judge to admonish the crowd to stay quiet during the testimony. The crowd viewed Waters’ grueling and often repetitive cross-examination, meant to eviscerate what remains of Murdaugh’s credibility. It came after the ginger-haired 54-year-old took the witness stand Feb. 23 and offered his latest version of the night Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot, forcefully insisting he did not kill them at the family’s spacious hunting estate on June 7, 2021.
Waters on Feb. 24 repeatedly alleged Murdaugh concocted the narrative only recently — carefully plotting his *“new story”* to align with testimony and evidence that came out over the trial’s first five weeks. Waters also reminded jurors that Murdaugh was forced to change his story after investigators shattered his first alibi: that he’d fallen asleep on the couch while his wife and son went to the dog kennels where they were found dead. A video found on Paul’s phone placed his father at the scene of the crime with both victims just minutes before prosecutors say the shootings began. |
|Waters put the defendant’s new alibi under a microscope. He slowed down the timeline, asking Murdaugh for a minute-by-minute retelling of his final moments with his wife and son. And crucially, he elicited testimony that Murdaugh was at the crime scene possibly as late as 8:47 p.m., just two minutes before 52-year-old Maggie and 22-year-old Paul abruptly stopped answering calls or opening messages on their phones. |
|Murdaugh testified he’d driven to and from the kennels on a golf cart, spending just a few minutes there with Maggie and Paul. He guessed it would have taken him two minutes to drive back to the estate’s main residence, meaning he would have arrived home just as the shootings began less than 400 yards away, according to a timeline presented by investigators. As he questioned Murdaugh, Waters also noted for the jury the contrast between moments the defendant could vividly recall and spots where his memories remained fuzzy. |
|Murdaugh, for example, could remember when he arrived at the kennels that evening, the family’s yellow lab, Bubba, was still peeing on nearby trees: his habit as soon as he was let out of his kennel. He didn’t remember the dogs seeming alarmed either, as they might if someone was lying in wait nearby. *“There was nobody around that the dogs didn’t know,”* Murdaugh said. *“There was nobody around for them to sense.”* |
|But Murdaugh couldn’t recall his final conversation with his wife in those moments or how long it lasted. Nor could he remember exactly where he left his phone for nearly an hour that evening during the time frame in which investigators say Maggie and Paul were killed. Murdaugh also couldn’t explain what he was doing in the four minutes after apparently picking up his phone at 9:02 p.m. Phone data show he was moving about twice as quickly during those minutes as he had all afternoon. Murdaugh said he was preparing to visit his mother in nearby Almeda, but he conceded he had already showered and dressed and couldn’t remember exactly what he was doing. Waters called Murdaugh a *“busy bee.”* He sarcastically asked Murdaugh: Were you hitting the treadmill? Doing jumping jacks? Jogging in place? No, Murdaugh said. *“I know what I wasn’t doing, Mr. Waters,”* Murdaugh said. *“What I wasn’t doing is doing anything — as I believe you’ve implied — that I was cleaning off or washing off guns, putting guns in a raincoat. And I can promise you that I wasn’t doing any of that.”* |
| Murdaugh began the day facing the jury, but as Waters’ cross-examination grew more confrontational, he gradually turned to face the prosecutor head-on. At one point, after Murdaugh professed he hadn’t manufactured an alibi, Waters paused to consider his next question. Murdaugh stared him down for several seconds. During one tense exchange, Murdaugh repeated his theory of why his wife and son were killed. He said he still believes someone who held Paul responsible for the 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach had carried out the slayings, though Murdaugh made clear he didn’t believe the killer was one of the boat crash survivors or their families. Paul was criminally charged with drunkenly driving the boat when it crashed into a Beaufort County bridge piling, ejecting Beach and other passengers. A wrongful death suit was filed against the Murdaughs by Beach’s family shortly after the crash; a settlement was approved in January. The boat crash survivors also sued the Murdaughs over the wreck. Between breaks to compose himself, Murdaugh said Paul had been misrepresented and vilified by news outlets and on social media. His son had received *“vile”* messages and threats. *“I believed then and I believe today that the wrong person saw and read that because I can tell you for a fact that the person or people who did what I saw on June the 7th, they hated Paul Murdaugh, and they had anger in their heart,”* Murdaugh said. *“And that is the only — only — reason that somebody could be mad at (Paul) like that and hate him like that.”* |
|Waters mocked this theory as yet another of Murdaugh’s lies. He went on a brief monologue meant to show jurors it would be implausible for anyone else to carry out the crime with the established evidence.|
|Waters said Murdaugh wanted the jury to believe the crime was carried out by a *“random vigilante”* who just happened *“to know that Paul and Maggie were both at Moselle on June 7, that knew that they would be at the kennels alone on June 7, that knew that you would not be there, but only between the times of 8:49 p.m. and 9:02 p.m., that they show up without a weapon assuming that they’re going to find weapons and ammunitions there, that they commit this crime during that short time window, and then they travel the same exact route that you do around the same time to Almeda.”* |
| *“That’s what you’re trying to tell this jury?”* Waters asked. |
| *“You’ve got a lot of factors in there, Mr. Waters, all of which I do not agree with, but some of which I do,”* Murdaugh replied. |
| As Waters and Murdaugh went back and forth, rarely agreeing, it sometimes became unclear who was testifying. Waters used the exchange to push his theory that Murdaugh killed Maggie and Paul to engender sympathy for himself and buy time to cover up his many alleged financial crimes. Waters regularly made assertions and then tacked a short question onto the end, such as, *“isn’t that correct?”* *“When accountability is at your door, Mr. Murdaugh, bad things happen, isn’t that true?”* Waters asked at one point. *“For the first time in your life of privilege and prominence and wealth, when you were facing accountability, each time suddenly, you became a victim, and everyone ran to your aid,” Waters asked at another. *“Isn’t that true?”* Most often, Murdaugh disagreed. |
|Later on Feb. 24, The Post and Courier learned local authorities had quietly charged Murdaugh with an additional misdemeanor related to a contraband violation involving a book. Details were scarce about the new charge, which appeared on the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office’s website sometime on Feb. 24. Efforts to reach the sheriff’s office for comment late Feb. 24 were unsuccessful. |
|Murdaugh’s testimony on Feb. 24 came near the close of the defense’s case. One of his attorneys, Dick Harpootlian, indicated the defense would call a handful of other witnesses before resting on Feb. 27. After that, Waters said, the state plans to call one or two more witnesses before moving on to closing arguments. In a case that has meandered through evidence of shootings, drugs and thefts, there finally is an end in sight.|

|Disbarred attorney facing jailhouse contraband charge|
| Disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh is currently on trial for two homicide charges and accompanying weapons charges. Beyond that, he is staring down nearly a hundred financial charges, drug charges and fraud charges (the latter of which are tied to a bizarre roadside shooting incident from Labor Day 2021). |
|You can now add a jailhouse contraband charge to the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga …|
|Colleton County authorities have yet to comment on the specifics of the allegation, but Murdaugh is believed by some to be staring down this misdemeanor charge in the aftermath of allegedly receiving contraband material from a family member earlier during the trial. Others are pointing the finger at his attorneys in the aftermath of a jailhouse lunch meeting earlier this week. News of the Murdaugh misdemeanor was first reported by Avery Wilks of The (Charleston, S.C.) Post and Courier.|
|As our audience will recall, on February 9, 2023 this news outlet reported that S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman – the man presiding over Murdaugh’s double homicide trial – issued multiple warnings to several members of Murdaugh’s family regarding their behavior in court. As a result, Murdaugh’s family was instructed to move from its front row seat at the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century’ to the back row of seats on the defendant’s side of the Colleton County courthouse. In addition to improper communication and contact with the defendant, *“one family member is alleged to have passed an ‘undisclosed item’ to Murdaugh through one of his attorneys – resulting in a court-ordered drug test of the defendant, whose alleged addiction to opioids has become one of the themes of these proceedings.”* It is not clear whether any other individuals will be charged in connection with Murdaugh’s alleged possession of contraband material. |
|While most of the speculation regarding the contraband charge centered around Murdaugh’s family, sources familiar with the inner workings of the court noted that Murdaugh’s attorneys were allowed inside a cell with him during lunch on Thursday afternoon. Such meetings are supposed to take place in a special cell where the lawyers are separated from Murdaugh by a pane of glass, but according to our sources *“they went in the cell instead.”* Whatever prompted the charge, Colleton County sheriff’s office deputies had intended to wait until the conclusion of Murdaugh’s double homicide trial to formally submit the paperwork on the misdemeanor but for some unknown reason the warrant was entered this afternoon. Murdaugh spent the past two days on the stand in Walterboro – testifying on his own behalf in his double homicide trial. These proceedings – which began on January 23 – are expected to conclude at some point next week. At that point, Murdaugh’s fate will be in the hands of twelve Colleton County jurors.|

| **[Alex Murdaugh had badge and blue lights in his car, but says ‘distrust’ of police fueled lie](https://www.postandcourier.com/murdaugh-updates/alex-murdaugh-had-badge-and-blue-lights-in-his-car-but-says-distrust-of-police/article_6a69aad4-b530-11ed-991d-0f61a49c3f4f.html)** |
|WALTERBORO — Former attorney Alex Murdaugh had such a cozy relationship with law enforcement in the Lowcountry that he put blue lights in his car with their blessing and carried a badge in case he needed a favor. He’d come from a family synonymous with enforcing the law as prosecutors in the southern tip of South Carolina for more than eight decades. He tried only a few criminal cases himself to spend time with his father, a former solicitor. But despite his limited involvement, Murdaugh treated himself to the trappings of office, including a shiny gold badge.
Because of their close ties to Murdaugh, the local law enforcement establishment quickly recused itself from the investigation into the shooting deaths of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul on June 7, 2021, at the family’s sprawling hunting estate on the Salkehatchie River. When out-of-town investigators from the State Law Enforcement Division took their place, Murdaugh says he was overcome by intrusive thoughts that told him he was their target. He attributed those notions to a paranoia fueled by his long-hidden opioid addiction. It was his distrust of state police, he said, that led him to tell perhaps the most important lie of his life: that he hadn’t been with Maggie and Paul in the minutes before they died. Once he told investigators that story, he continued to repeat it to those he was closest with, including his slain wife’s grieving mother. Twenty months after the killings, Murdaugh recanted that lie and several others in front of 12 strangers on a Colleton County jury deciding his fate , this man, who once carried a badge, harbored such misgivings about the officers questioning him that he was willing to mislead them as they hunted for the person who killed his wife and son. Unlike his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, Murdaugh didn’t have a career as a prosecutor. His specialty was as a personal injury lawyer, filing lawsuits in the civil courts over matters like car wrecks.|
|But as 14th Circuit solicitor, Murdaugh’s father, Randolph, took his son on as a volunteer prosecutor. And though he only led one criminal trial in more than two decades, Murdaugh used the position to justify having blue lights installed in the vehicle his law firm provided him.|
|He did not do so without permission: Murdaugh testified he first sought and won the blessing of three counties’ sheriffs, whom he considered friends — under state law, only emergency vehicles and security patrol cars can display blue lights. Though Murdaugh was in a volunteer role and he could not remember taking an oath to receive it, he was granted a badge by the solicitor’s office. Murdaugh’s father gave him one first, and his successor — the current solicitor, Duffie Stone — signed off on another. He inherited his grandfather’s badge, as well, giving him an extra.|
|From the witness stand, Murdaugh admitted he sometimes made use of the “warming effect” the badge had on police, leaving it on his vehicle’s dashboard or in the cupholder — anywhere an officer could see it if he was pulled over. *“Did I hang it out of my pocket when I wanted an advantage?”* Murdaugh said with a slight smile. *“I may have.”* |
|A badge hung from the pocket of his khakis when he showed up at the hospital the night his son Paul allegedly crashed the family boat, injuring his friends and killing 19-year-old Mallory Beach. One was on his dashboard when his SUV was impounded after the killings in June 2021. One was in the car when he unsuccessfully tried to stage his own killing three months later.
| *“Law enforcement oftentimes is friendlier if they know you’re law enforcement,”* Murdaugh told the jury, though he conceded he was not himself law enforcement. Murdaugh’s close relationship with local police departments and sheriff’s offices was not a secret, and examples of it have dribbled out throughout the trial. Murdaugh testified that he and law partners had hosted events at which police were *“always invited.”* |
|One of his law firm’s former runners testified he sometimes ran into a local police chief, Greg Alexander, in Murdaugh’s office after going to the bank to cash checks for the lawyer.|
|And the head of the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office’s investigative division testified that on his drive to the June 2021 crime scene, the sheriff was already talking to him about calling in SLED because his agency was too close to the Murdaughs. So were his friends and family. When SLED’s crime scene team was ready to document the area around the crime scene, first responders did not shoo Murdaugh’s supporters, who included more than a half-dozen prominent trial attorneys, from his estate.|
|Instead, they urged the group to go to Murdaugh’s main residence, according to two of his former law partners. One of them, Mark Ball, found the request odd because he thought the house might be considered part of the crime scene. He was confused enough that he asked for clarification. But Ball was assured it was fine to be there, he testified. Back at the house, a few people started tidying up, putting away food that was sitting out on the stove, for instance, Ball said. He said it didn’t seem as though investigators had yet searched the house.|
|The next day, the house was still open. Murdaugh, his surviving son Buster, and Buster’s girlfriend Brooklynn White returned in the morning, and each showered there, Murdaugh and Buster testified. The Murdaughs’ housekeeper, Blanca Turrbiate-Simpson, went unobstructed as she cleaned the house and rinsed out Murdaugh’s shower, though agents came inside while she was there. *“I didn’t ask any questions; they didn’t ask me. They just went about doing what they were doing,”* Turribate-Simpson said.|
|Had there been evidence in the showers before they were used or washed out, it wouldn’t have mattered to the investigation anyway: SLED didn’t swab them for blood or DNA, agents testified. When SLED did search the house the day after the killings, agents decided not to remove Murdaugh’s guests, though they had a search warrant that would have allowed them to do so. Instead, Murdaugh’s attorney friends lounged in his wood-paneled gun room while agents decided what firearms to take away for testing. They were even allowed to weigh in on the process. One agent, Katie McCallister, let one of Murdaugh’s brothers and one of his law partners follow her as she searched the rest of the house for evidence. So deferential was SLED’s approach that Ball said McCallister even offered to take off her service weapon and police identification before she started going through the house, in case Murdaugh’s supporters wanted her to keep a low profile.|
|Despite having friends in law enforcement, in Murdaugh’s telling, even the local police sometimes triggered paranoid thoughts, like when an officer pulled onto the road behind him. It was a symptom of his decades-long dependence on painkillers, he said, and a consequence of the pills he constantly carried.|
|Few people outside his family knew he had an addiction, he said; every trip risked exposure. Still, the thoughts would normally pass, he said, quelled by a couple of deep breaths. But when he interacted with SLED during their investigation, he said, the uneasy thoughts burrowed into his mind. His hands had been swabbed for gunshot residue. Gathered at his estate, his law partners insisted that he not talk to investigators alone. Alexander, the Yemassee police chief and his friend, told him not to talk to officers. He thought he heard Colleton County’s sheriff give the same advice. And as his wife and son lay dead nearby, he said his mind turned to the stash of illegal pills he was carrying. Murdaugh ultimately spoke with investigators that night anyway, joined by a law partner who’d been his personal attorney. Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters played the interview during Murdaugh’s testimony, pausing often to ask when he made up his mind to lie. Murdaugh demurred, saying there was no one moment. But he said his thoughts were triggered when Owen asked a few short questions about his relationships with 52-year-old Maggie and Paul, 22. (Owen did not press him when he said his marriage was *“wonderful”* and his connection with his son was *“as good as it could be.”*) |
|But Murdaugh said his distrust of SLED went back years because of past run-ins with state investigators. Paul had been investigated when he allegedly crashed a family boat in 2019, killing Beach and injuring others. He was accused of boating under the influence, charges that were still pending when he died. (Though Murdaugh tied the boat crash case to SLED, the state Department of Natural Resources led the investigation.) And he said Paul and Buster had been investigated over *“some rumors,”* though he did not specify what he was referring to. He claimed SLED had cleared his sons but that the agency wouldn’t say so publicly. And he testified that he mistook Owen for another SLED agent he thought *“manufactured charges”* against a friend who was accused of pocketing thousands of dollars in government money. He said he and his father, a career prosecutor, found the charges so egregious that they made a *“conscious decision”* to sit with him at trial to show their support. His friend ultimately prevailed with a not guilty verdict.|
|Murdaugh told the story to demonstrate his misgivings about SLED, but it also served to highlight just how close he was with local law enforcement. The friend he thought SLED did wrong was Alexander, the police chief who came to his home the night of the killings.|
