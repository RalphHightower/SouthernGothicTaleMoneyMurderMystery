| WALTERBORO — If Buster Murdaugh believes his father killed his mother and brother, he didn’t show it when he testified Feb. 21 before a Colleton County jury. Instead, Alex Murdaugh’s surviving son took the witness stand and offered the defense a boost. Over the course of two hours, Buster provided explanations for some of his father’s behavior in the hours and days after Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot to death on June 7, 2021. His answers helped diffuse some of the theories and suspicions prosecutors floated about his father over the double murder trial’s first four weeks. For example, prosecutors have alleged it was strange Murdaugh, 54, left the family’s hunting estate through its main driveway on the night of the slayings, rather than using another driveway by the dog kennels where Maggie and Paul were killed. Buster testified that wasn’t unusual: His family typically used the main driveway. Prosecutors have also implied Murdaugh parked in an unusual place during a late-night visit to his parents’ house on the evening of the slayings: behind the house, instead of the main carport. They have hinted the former attorney did so to hide evidence, including the still-unrecovered murder weapons, by the property’s treeline. Buster, however, testified visitors commonly parked there, especially at night, in order to use the home’s back door. |
|So it went for question after question as defense attorney Jim Griffin methodically walked Buster, 26, through many of the case’s loose ends and unanswered questions. Dressed in a dark suit and a crisp white shirt, Buster appeared stoic and distant on the witness stand, calmly and politely answering Griffin. He has maintained this demeanor throughout the trial, even as the uncles and aunts he sits with have regularly broken into tears. Murdaugh held a slight smile through much of his son’s testimony. He grew emotional only when Buster recalled the moment his father told him Maggie and Paul had been shot. Murdaugh patted Buster on the hip as he left the courtroom during a break. Buster didn’t say whether he thinks his father committed the crime, nor was he directly asked. But he and his relatives have sat a few rows behind Murdaugh each day of the trial, and several of them are on the defense’s list of potential witnesses.|
|Buster’s testimony countered one key aspect of the state’s theory in particular: that Murdaugh snuck off to his parents’ house in the days after the slayings to dispose of the murder weapons for good. One of the state’s star witnesses, a caregiver for Murdaugh’s mother, testified she saw Murdaugh coming and going from his parents’ property in Almeda early one morning about a week after Maggie and Paul were killed at the family’s Colleton County hunting estate. Murdaugh also centered the home at one point carrying something blue and taking it upstairs, Shelley Smith testified.|
|Prosecutors believe that blue object was a rain jacket that was covered in gunshot residue on the inside. They allege Murdaugh had wrapped at least one of the murder weapons — a 12-gauge shotgun used to kill 22-year-old Paul and a .300 Blackout military-style rifle used to kill Maggie, 52 — within the coat. Prosecutors also have hinted that they believe Murdaugh used the early morning visit to his parents’ house to retrieve and dispose of the guns for good. |
|But under questioning from Griffin, Buster said he spent 10 straight days with his father after the killings, staying together at family members’ homes around the state. *“Do you ever remember your dad disappearing for periods of time?”* Griffin asked. *“No, sir,”* Buster replied. *“Were you physically close to him most all the time?”* Griffin asked. *“Yes, sir,”* Buster said. |
|Another controversial piece of evidence Buster testified about was the supposed confession investigators say Alex gave during a June 10, 2021, interview with State Law Enforcement Division agents. An investigator testified he heard Murdaugh say *“I did him so bad”* while breaking into hysterics, apparently admitting to killing Paul. But investigators never followed up on the alleged admission or even wrote it in their notes. Murdaugh’s attorneys contend an audio recording of the interview clearly shows Murdaugh said, *“They did him so bad,”* referring to Paul’s killer. On the witness stand Feb. 21, Buster agreed. He said his father repeated, *“They did him so bad,”* over and over in the hours and days after the slayings, referring to the grisly shotgun blasts that killed Paul. |
|Griffin also questioned Buster about his father’s opioid addiction. Buster said the family was aware of it for years. Murdaugh had entered treatment for drug abuse after Christmas in 2018, Buster recalled, and the family thought he had kicked it. But they were wrong, and Paul and Maggie occasionally confronted Murdaugh when they found pills he shouldn’t have been taking, Buster said. Buster testified his father was always apologetic during those confrontations, which remained civil. *“Was there any violence in the family?”* Griffin asked. *“No, sir,”* Buster said. In the first full day of presenting their own case, the defense sought to cast doubt on the story prosecutors laid out to jurors over four weeks about how and why Maggie and Paul were shot. |
|The defense began offering their own narrative by calling a mechanical engineer, Mike Sutton, to discuss his theory of where the shooter was standing based on where stray bullets landed. Bullets pierced a quail cage and dog house near where Maggie was found dead, for instance. Based on State Law Enforcement Division agents’ measurements of how those structures were hit and the location where bullet casings were found, Sutton testified the rifle would have been fired relatively low to the ground. Sutton testified that makes it implausible Murdaugh, who stands 6-foot-4, could have been the triggerman. He estimated the shooter was no taller than 5-foot-4. *“It’s very unlikely that he fired that shot,”* Sutton said.|
|On cross-examination, prosecutor David Fernandez took aim at Sutton’s credibility. Though the state had no objection to Sutton being admitted as an expert witness, Fernandez led Sutton through a battery of questions about his lack of training and expertise in firearms, shooting incident reconstruction and pathology. Fernandez was quick to elicit testimony that Murdaugh paid Sutton’s company $350 an hour for its work on his case, and that Sutton had already worked more than 40 hours. Fernandez suggested Sutton’s opinions were mere guesswork, not science. He repeatedly mocked the engineer’s three-dimensional model of Maggie’s shooting, which depicted the shooter as an anonymous, short male figure. Fernandez repeatedly referred to it as a 12-year-old child before defense attorney Dick Harpootlian objected and Judge Clifton Newman put a stop to it. Murdaugh’s team will continue to call witnesses when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 22. |

|Surviving son of Alex Murdaugh pokes holes in prosecution’s case …|
|The surviving son of disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh took the stand on Tuesday morning – the first substantive witness called by attorneys who are defending his father on murder charges.|
|Murdaugh is the scion of an influential Lowcountry legal dynasty – a man who once led the Palmetto State’s powerful trial lawyers’ association. Today, he sits at the epicenter of a maze of alleged criminality known as the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga. Murdaugh stands accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and is currently standing trial in Walterboro – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his famous family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century. |
|Buster Murdaugh, 26, testified extensively to the Murdaugh family’s dynamics – including his father’s loving relationship with him, his brother, his mother and her parents, Terry Branstetter and Kennedy Branstetter. More substantively, Murdaugh challenged prosecutors’ interpretation of recently obtained vehicular data which showed his father’s Suburban circling behind his grandparents’ home in Almeda, S.C. upon its arrival shortly after the murders – parking near several outbuildings near a line of trees.|
| *“The Suburban goes to outbuildings by the wood line,”* special agent Peter Rudofski of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) testified. According to Buster Murdaugh, the location of the Suburban behind his grandparents’ residence was consistent with someone accessing the home from the rear entrance. *“Was it common to go in the back door?”* attorney Jim Griffin asked Murdaugh. *“Yes sir,”* he responded. This was one of many key components of the prosecution’s case addressed during Murdaugh’s testimony. |
|Buster Murdaugh also testified his father’s demeanor was *“completely normal”* when he called him after 9:10 p.m. EDT – approximately twenty minutes after the murders took place – saying his tone was *“no different”* than it was on any of the previous calls he had exchanged with him earlier in the day. Buster Murdaugh also lent support to key points in the defense’s narrative – saying his father did not always carry his phone with him on the Moselle property and often showered and changed clothes in the evenings after dinner. Perhaps most significantly, Murdaugh challenged the prosecution’s assertion that his father was wearing a sea foam-colored Columbia brand shirt in the hours leading up to the murders. *“It doesn’t look like a Columbia shirt,”* Murdaugh testified, adding he believed the shirt was *“blue.”* |
|In addition to debunking several prosecutorial points, Buster Murdaugh provided new insight into his father’s widely cited opioid addiction, referring to a 2018 stint Alex Murdaugh allegedly spent in a detoxification facility. He further testified to learning about his mother and brother discovering pills belonging to his father in 2021 – but indicated he assumed Alex Murdaugh had beaten his addiction. |
|On the night of the murders, Buster Murdaugh – who was in Rock Hill, S.C. with his girlfriend at the time – testified to learning of the savage slayings via a phone call with his father at approximately 10:47 p.m. EDT. *“He asked me if I was sitting down – then he told me my mother and brother had been shot,”* Murdaugh testified. Upon arriving at Moselle hours later, Buster Murdaugh testified his father was *“destroyed”* and could hardly speak. In the days after the killings, Alex Murdaugh offered to pay for private security for Buster – but his son declined the offer, saying he valued his privacy and *“didn’t want to carry a gun.”* |
|From the very beginning, Buster Murdaugh has been among the most elusive figures in the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga – although the limited commentary he previously provided pointed to him being a potentially hostile witness for the defense. That is clearly not how things played out on Tuesday … |
