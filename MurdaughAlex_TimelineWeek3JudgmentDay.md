| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Prosecution Scores Huge Admissibility Win](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/06/murdaugh-murders-saga-prosecution-scores-huge-admissibility-win/)<br>Judge insists evidence of financial crimes is *“more probative than prejudicial.”*<br>Prosecutors seeking to put disbarred attorney/ accused killer Alex Murdaugh behind bars for life scored a major win on Monday when South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman ruled they could call witnesses, elicit testimony and introduce evidence related to various financial crimes of which Murdaugh stands accused.<br>
Murdaugh allegedly killed his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty and is currently standing trial in Walterboro, S.C. – part of the five-county Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his family once ran like a fiefdom. In addition to this double homicide, Murdaugh is facing 99 individual charges related to *“schemes to defraud victims”* of nearly $10 million.|
|Prosecutors claim the potential exposure of Murdaugh’s financial crimes were a possible motive for murder – making this evidence admissible under Rule 404(b) of the South Carolina rules of criminal procedure. According to that rule, evidence of *“other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person.”* However, the rule does permit such *“prior bad acts”* to be admitted in order *“to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.”* |
|Newman concluded the state had met the threshold for the admission of this evidence, saying *“the jury is entitled to hear whether the apparent desperation of Murdaugh due to his dire financial situation and threat of being exposed”* was his motive for murder. *“This evidence is admissible,”* Newman ruled, arguing the evidence was *“more probative than prejudicial”* and would *“aid the jury in understanding the context in which the crime occurred.”* Newman’s ruling paves the way for jurors to hear testimony from multiple witnesses who have already provided incriminating testimony against Murdaugh outside the presence of the jury.|
|Those witnesses include …|
|Carson Burney: Auditor with the S.C. Department of Revenue (SCDOR) who assisted the statewide grand jury in tracing monies allegedly stolen by Murdaugh from a variety of sources.|
Michael Gunn: Principal of Forge Consulting, a company Alex Murdaugh appears to have mimicked in an effort to fleece proceeds from legal settlements.|
|Jan Malinowski: President and chief executive officer of Palmetto State Bank. Malinowski’s predecessor, Russell Laffitte, has already been convicted of conspiring with Murdaugh to steal millions of dollars from his former clients.|
|Tony Satterfield: Son of Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh’s former housekeeper whose suspicious 2018 death led to a multi-million dollar settlement from Alex Murdaugh’s insurance providers. Murdaugh allegedly stole those settlement proceeds from Tony and his brother. In fact, Murdaugh has already confessed judgment in connection with the Satterfield case.|
|Jeanne Seckinger: The comptroller of Murdaugh’s former law firm, Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth and Detrick (PMPED). Seckinger confronted Murdaugh about missing fees from a PMPED account on the day of the murders. She testified Murdaugh shot her a *“glare”* she had never seen before in more than two decades of working with him.|
|Mark Tinsley: The lead attorney in the 2019 boat crash case that claimed the life of 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. Tinsley was suing Murdaugh in connection with his wrongful death action on behalf of Beach’s family, and a hearing was scheduled for June 10, 2021 regarding a motion to compel the production of Murdaugh’s financial information. Murdaugh was working a response to that motion on the day of the murders.|
|Chris Wilson: Murdaugh’s best friend and a fellow attorney who worked several cases with him. Wilson testified that Murdaugh stole nearly $200,000 from him in the days leading up to the murders – and acknowledged this theft months later.|

|WALTERBORO — In the coming days of Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial, jurors will hear testimony accusing the once-prominent Hampton lawyer of secretly stealing millions of dollars from friends, family, clients and others who trusted him for the better part of a decade.<br>Judge Clifton Newman on Feb. 6 decided evidence of those alleged financial crimes could be admitted as Murdaugh stands trial on charges of fatally shooting his wife, Maggie, and son Paul in June 2021 at the family’s hunting estate.|
|Newman’s ruling was a major victory for the S.C. Attorney General’s Office, which for nearly two months has said Murdaugh’s alleged financial wrongdoing is central to its theory of the case. The judge’s decision also will extend the length of the trial taking place at the Colleton County Courthouse. Proceedings were initially expected to wrap up this week. Now, the end of the trial is no longer in sight.|
|Newman’s ruling resolves a protracted dispute between prosecutors and Murdaugh’s legal team. The legal decision also could give Murdaugh, 54, grounds for an appeal if he is convicted. 
Defense attorneys contend the financial evidence is prejudicial and unrelated to the crimes charged in this case. They argue that prosecutors can’t prove Murdaugh killed his wife and son, so they need to show the jury he is a bad guy who deserves punishment.|
|But prosecutors say the evidence provides Murdaugh’s motive for the slayings. They hope to show jurors Murdaugh knew on June 7, 2021, that his misdeeds were going to be exposed. With his career and reputation on the line, Murdaugh that evening used both a rifle and a shotgun to eliminate his 52-year-old wife and son, 22, prosecutors allege. They say he did so to portray himself as the victim of an “unspeakable tragedy” and to buy time for a cover up. The prosecution’s strategy is not without risks. The alleged financial crimes give the jury a tangible reason to explain why Murdaugh would kill his wife and son. But the swirl of numbers, bank ledgers and custodial witnesses could also risk confusing jurors already navigating a complicated narrative in the case. In announcing his decision, Newman cited testimony from some of the seven witnesses who have testified with the jury excused from the courtroom — about Murdaugh’s thefts and betrayals. Now, those witnesses could return to the stand to tell their stories again, this time for the jury to hear.|
|Among them was Jeanne Seckinger, the chief financial officer of Murdaugh’s former law firm — the Hampton legal institution founded by his great-grandfather. Seckinger testified that she confronted Murdaugh, hours before the murders, over $792,000 in missing legal fees from a case he had worked.|
|Hampton-based Palmetto State Bank would have stopped loaning Murdaugh money and allowing him to overdraft his accounts if it had known Murdaugh was stealing from his legal clients and law partners, bank CEO Jan Malinoski testified last week.|
|On Feb. 6, Allendale attorney Mark Tinsley testified about his efforts in spring 2021 to force Murdaugh to reveal details of his bank records. Tinsley was suing the Murdaugh family on behalf of the parents of Mallory Beach, who died in a 2019 boat crash in Beaufort County. Paul Murdaugh, before his death, was awaiting trial on accusations he was drunk and slammed the boat into a bridge piling at Parris Island, resulting in her death. Tinsley wanted financial disclosures to verify Alex Murdaugh’s claim he was broke and had little money to pay the Beach family in a wrongful death settlement. |
|Prosecutors say those records would have laid bare Murdaugh’s shaky finances and his practice of stealing money to cover his massive debts. A hearing on whether Murdaugh would be forced to hand over his financial records was scheduled for June 10, 2021. It was canceled after the Murdaugh family slayings.|
| *“If the hearing takes place on June 10, 2021, what is the net effect of what could happen with that?”* lead prosecutor Creighton Waters asked. *“The discovery of everything he’s done,”* Tinsley said.|
|The ruling to admit evidence of Murdaugh’s alleged financial crimes resolved one fight in the double murder trial. Another conflict emerged immediately thereafter. This one centers on one of the few pieces of physical evidence introduced by prosecutors that could have a direct link to the killings.|
|Prosecutors want jurors to hear about a blue rain jacket investigators seized from the house of Murdaugh’s parents, which they say showed high levels of gunshot residue. Defense lawyers say prosecutors can’t link the jacket to their client. Prosecutors so far have relied on a single witness to do so; her testimony Feb. 6 caused more confusion than clarity.|
|Mushelle “Shelley” Smith, who was a caregiver for Murdaugh’s mother in 2021, said Murdaugh arrived early one morning in the days after the killings, which was unusual. He was cradling what appeared to be a blue tarp, she said. Investigators didn’t learn about the tarp for months. Smith said the first time she mentioned it to police was when she was chatting with an Allendale officer after a car wreck. Allendale police notified the State Law Enforcement Division, which searched the home of Murdaugh’s parents in September 2021. They found a blue tarp in a plastic storage tub in one closet and an oversized blue rain jacket crumpled in the back of another, SLED agent Kristin Moore testified. The poncho-style jacket was so large that Moore had to reach out her arms to hold it up. Prosecutors suggested its size could lead someone to mistake it for a tarp. It isn’t clear which, if either, of those items Smith claims to have seen Murdaugh carrying.|
|When prosecutors showed her a photo of the rain jacket in the back of the closet, she said it looked like what she saw Murdaugh carrying that morning. Defense attorney Jim Griffin later showed her a photo of the jacket laid out. At that point, she said it didn’t look like what Murdaugh brought to the house. The uncertainty over Smith’s testimony came to a head at the end of the day Feb. 6, when defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian asked Newman to bar testimony about gunshot residue found on the jacket. He argued that Smith, the only person connecting the jacket to Murdaugh, testified she didn’t see him with it.|
|Waters, the lead prosecutor, said her testimony established a connection. Unable to agree on what Smith said, Harpootlian suggested Newman pull a transcript of her testimony.|
|The issue is likely to be discussed further Feb. 7, when the SLED lab analyst who ran gunshot residue tests is expected to testify.|

|A front row seat to history …|
| A front row seat to history … |
| *“Who is the woman in the racing jacket?”* |
|That’s been among the most popular questions I’ve received from members of our audience during the ongoing double homicide trial of disbarred attorney/ accused killer Alex Murdaugh – the man at the center of the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|After people inquire as to the identity of the “woman with the jacket” – which is adorned with numerous NASCAR patches – there is the inevitable follow-up question: How did she get such a great seat in the courtroom|
|The woman in the racing jacket is Jean Langston, a Lowcountry artist who has spent more than two decades teaching art to students in Hampton and Colleton counties. I had the pleasure of meeting Langston during a recent trip to the Artists’ Hub of the ACE Basin (a.k.a. AHAB) in downtown Walterboro. Located a block away from the courthouse (at 255 E. Washington Street), AHAB is an arts’ cafe that serves up coffee and confection along with all manner of local creativity – including several handmade retail knickknacks and a stage for aspiring musicians. Looking for an afternoon caffeine infusion? Or a souvenir from your visit to ‘the ‘Boro?” AHAB has got you covered …|
|Seated at a table inside this unique space I found Langston, whose story adorns the front page of the latest print edition of The Walterboro Press and Standard. *“I’m using my own sick days to try and improve myself as an artist,”* Langston told me of her multiple visits to the Colleton County courthouse, where she has been sketching Murdaugh and other key players in the still-unfolding ‘Trial of the Century.’|
|Langston has had an amazing view of the proceedings. When the jury is present, she has been seated directly across from them on the east side of the courtroom – right next to the CourtTV camera and audio operators. This vantage point has afforded her an unrivaled, unobstructed view of Murdaugh as he stands trial for the murders of his wife and son. *“It’s been interesting,”* Langston told me. *“It’s kinda crazy watching all the tears come out of him. It’s like why are you crying … did you do it?”* |
|Langston said she hasn’t made up her mind about Murdaugh’s guilt or innocence, but as she has sketched him she’s been making mental notes about the moments during the proceedings when he has shown emotion. *“He’s crying about the bullet shells – why are you crying about the bullet shells?”* she wondered. *“You’re looking at the (Murdaugh) family sitting behind him – it’s hard for them,”** she continued. “You know they don’t know either … they’re trying to find out, too.”*|
|Langston told me the evidence of financial crimes committed by Murdaugh has been extremely compelling – an interesting observation considering this evidence has just been deemed admissible by S.C. circuit court judge judge Clifton Newman. *“I mean he stole all this money,”* she said.|
|She told me she also couldn’t help but take note of the testimony of Jan Malinowski, the president of Palmetto State Bank who told the court about Murdaugh running up a negative balance of more than $350,000. *“I get in trouble if I have a $35 overdraft fee,”* she said.|
|Langston told me she is planning to sell her work on EBay after the trial – and might reach out to some of the attorneys she has sketched to see if they are interested in her originals She also told me she’s available for commission work.|
|As for AHAB, this 501(c)3 nonprofit – which exists to support fellow *“artists/ crafters/ musicians”* – reminded me of the local creativity I saw on display during a recent visit to Hampton, S.C., the home of the Murdaugh dynasty. It also served as another example of the city of Walterboro showcasing its local talent as it continues to play the role of inviting, accommodating host to the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century.’|
