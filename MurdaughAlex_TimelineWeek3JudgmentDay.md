| **[‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Prosecution Scores Huge Admissibility Win](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/06/murdaugh-murders-saga-prosecution-scores-huge-admissibility-win/)>** <br>Judge insists evidence of financial crimes is *“more probative than prejudicial.”*<br>Prosecutors seeking to put disbarred attorney/ accused killer Alex Murdaugh behind bars for life scored a major win on Monday when South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman ruled they could call witnesses, elicit testimony and introduce evidence related to various financial crimes of which Murdaugh stands accused.<br>
Murdaugh allegedly killed his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty and is currently standing trial in Walterboro, S.C. – part of the five-county Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his family once ran like a fiefdom. In addition to this double homicide, Murdaugh is facing 99 individual charges related to *“schemes to defraud victims”* of nearly $10 million.|
|Prosecutors claim the potential exposure of Murdaugh’s financial crimes were a possible motive for murder – making this evidence admissible under Rule 404(b) of the South Carolina rules of criminal procedure. According to that rule, evidence of *“other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person.”* However, the rule does permit such *“prior bad acts”* to be admitted in order *“to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.”* |
|Newman concluded the state had met the threshold for the admission of this evidence, saying *“the jury is entitled to hear whether the apparent desperation of Murdaugh due to his dire financial situation and threat of being exposed”* was his motive for murder. *“This evidence is admissible,”* Newman ruled, arguing the evidence was *“more probative than prejudicial”* and would *“aid the jury in understanding the context in which the crime occurred.”* Newman’s ruling paves the way for jurors to hear testimony from multiple witnesses who have already provided incriminating testimony against Murdaugh outside the presence of the jury.|
|Those witnesses include …|
|Carson Burney: Auditor with the S.C. Department of Revenue (SCDOR) who assisted the statewide grand jury in tracing monies allegedly stolen by Murdaugh from a variety of sources.|
Michael Gunn: Principal of Forge Consulting, a company Alex Murdaugh appears to have mimicked in an effort to fleece proceeds from legal settlements.|
|Jan Malinowski: President and chief executive officer of Palmetto State Bank. Malinowski’s predecessor, Russell Laffitte, has already been convicted of conspiring with Murdaugh to steal millions of dollars from his former clients.|
|Tony Satterfield: Son of Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh’s former housekeeper whose suspicious 2018 death led to a multi-million dollar settlement from Alex Murdaugh’s insurance providers. Murdaugh allegedly stole those settlement proceeds from Tony and his brother. In fact, Murdaugh has already confessed judgment in connection with the Satterfield case.|
|Jeanne Seckinger: The comptroller of Murdaugh’s former law firm, Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth and Detrick (PMPED). Seckinger confronted Murdaugh about missing fees from a PMPED account on the day of the murders. She testified Murdaugh shot her a *“glare”* she had never seen before in more than two decades of working with him.|
|Mark Tinsley: The lead attorney in the 2019 boat crash case that claimed the life of 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. Tinsley was suing Murdaugh in connection with his wrongful death action on behalf of Beach’s family, and a hearing was scheduled for June 10, 2021 regarding a motion to compel the production of Murdaugh’s financial information. Murdaugh was working a response to that motion on the day of the murders.|
|Chris Wilson: Murdaugh’s best friend and a fellow attorney who worked several cases with him. Wilson testified that Murdaugh stole nearly $200,000 from him in the days leading up to the murders – and acknowledged this theft months later.|

|WALTERBORO — In the coming days of Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial, jurors will hear testimony accusing the once-prominent Hampton lawyer of secretly stealing millions of dollars from friends, family, clients and others who trusted him for the better part of a decade.<br>Judge Clifton Newman on Feb. 6 decided evidence of those alleged financial crimes could be admitted as Murdaugh stands trial on charges of fatally shooting his wife, Maggie, and son Paul in June 2021 at the family’s hunting estate.|
|Newman’s ruling was a major victory for the S.C. Attorney General’s Office, which for nearly two months has said Murdaugh’s alleged financial wrongdoing is central to its theory of the case. The judge’s decision also will extend the length of the trial taking place at the Colleton County Courthouse. Proceedings were initially expected to wrap up this week. Now, the end of the trial is no longer in sight.|
|Newman’s ruling resolves a protracted dispute between prosecutors and Murdaugh’s legal team. The legal decision also could give Murdaugh, 54, grounds for an appeal if he is convicted. 
Defense attorneys contend the financial evidence is prejudicial and unrelated to the crimes charged in this case. They argue that prosecutors can’t prove Murdaugh killed his wife and son, so they need to show the jury he is a bad guy who deserves punishment.|
|But prosecutors say the evidence provides Murdaugh’s motive for the slayings. They hope to show jurors Murdaugh knew on June 7, 2021, that his misdeeds were going to be exposed. With his career and reputation on the line, Murdaugh that evening used both a rifle and a shotgun to eliminate his 52-year-old wife and son, 22, prosecutors allege. They say he did so to portray himself as the victim of an “unspeakable tragedy” and to buy time for a cover up. The prosecution’s strategy is not without risks. The alleged financial crimes give the jury a tangible reason to explain why Murdaugh would kill his wife and son. But the swirl of numbers, bank ledgers and custodial witnesses could also risk confusing jurors already navigating a complicated narrative in the case. In announcing his decision, Newman cited testimony from some of the seven witnesses who have testified with the jury excused from the courtroom — about Murdaugh’s thefts and betrayals. Now, those witnesses could return to the stand to tell their stories again, this time for the jury to hear.|
|Among them was Jeanne Seckinger, the chief financial officer of Murdaugh’s former law firm — the Hampton legal institution founded by his great-grandfather. Seckinger testified that she confronted Murdaugh, hours before the murders, over $792,000 in missing legal fees from a case he had worked.|
|Hampton-based Palmetto State Bank would have stopped loaning Murdaugh money and allowing him to overdraft his accounts if it had known Murdaugh was stealing from his legal clients and law partners, bank CEO Jan Malinoski testified last week.|
|On Feb. 6, Allendale attorney Mark Tinsley testified about his efforts in spring 2021 to force Murdaugh to reveal details of his bank records. Tinsley was suing the Murdaugh family on behalf of the parents of Mallory Beach, who died in a 2019 boat crash in Beaufort County. Paul Murdaugh, before his death, was awaiting trial on accusations he was drunk and slammed the boat into a bridge piling at Parris Island, resulting in her death. Tinsley wanted financial disclosures to verify Alex Murdaugh’s claim he was broke and had little money to pay the Beach family in a wrongful death settlement. |
|Prosecutors say those records would have laid bare Murdaugh’s shaky finances and his practice of stealing money to cover his massive debts. A hearing on whether Murdaugh would be forced to hand over his financial records was scheduled for June 10, 2021. It was canceled after the Murdaugh family slayings.|
| *“If the hearing takes place on June 10, 2021, what is the net effect of what could happen with that?”* lead prosecutor Creighton Waters asked. *“The discovery of everything he’s done,”* Tinsley said.|
|The ruling to admit evidence of Murdaugh’s alleged financial crimes resolved one fight in the double murder trial. Another conflict emerged immediately thereafter. This one centers on one of the few pieces of physical evidence introduced by prosecutors that could have a direct link to the killings.|
|Prosecutors want jurors to hear about a blue rain jacket investigators seized from the house of Murdaugh’s parents, which they say showed high levels of gunshot residue. Defense lawyers say prosecutors can’t link the jacket to their client. Prosecutors so far have relied on a single witness to do so; her testimony Feb. 6 caused more confusion than clarity.|
|Mushelle “Shelley” Smith, who was a caregiver for Murdaugh’s mother in 2021, said Murdaugh arrived early one morning in the days after the killings, which was unusual. He was cradling what appeared to be a blue tarp, she said. Investigators didn’t learn about the tarp for months. Smith said the first time she mentioned it to police was when she was chatting with an Allendale officer after a car wreck. Allendale police notified the State Law Enforcement Division, which searched the home of Murdaugh’s parents in September 2021. They found a blue tarp in a plastic storage tub in one closet and an oversized blue rain jacket crumpled in the back of another, SLED agent Kristin Moore testified. The poncho-style jacket was so large that Moore had to reach out her arms to hold it up. Prosecutors suggested its size could lead someone to mistake it for a tarp. It isn’t clear which, if either, of those items Smith claims to have seen Murdaugh carrying.|
|When prosecutors showed her a photo of the rain jacket in the back of the closet, she said it looked like what she saw Murdaugh carrying that morning. Defense attorney Jim Griffin later showed her a photo of the jacket laid out. At that point, she said it didn’t look like what Murdaugh brought to the house. The uncertainty over Smith’s testimony came to a head at the end of the day Feb. 6, when defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian asked Newman to bar testimony about gunshot residue found on the jacket. He argued that Smith, the only person connecting the jacket to Murdaugh, testified she didn’t see him with it.|
|Waters, the lead prosecutor, said her testimony established a connection. Unable to agree on what Smith said, Harpootlian suggested Newman pull a transcript of her testimony.|
|The issue is likely to be discussed further Feb. 7, when the SLED lab analyst who ran gunshot residue tests is expected to testify.|

| When my editors asked me to write about Alex Murdaugh’s hometown of Hampton, South Carolina, they warned me that few locals wanted to talk to the press.|
|They were right.|
|In the intense interest in the small town after Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were killed, and then again after Alex Murdaugh was arrested for their deaths, residents mostly wanted to distance themselves from the story.|
|So when my editors asked me if I’d do a story about Walterboro, the small town where Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial will be held, I expected the same kind of difficulty finding someone willing to talk on the record.|
|Not so.|
|The officials, shopkeepers and passersby I spoke to were happy to discuss what they were doing to prepare for the thousands of strangers who will soon flood their streets.|
|Some saw the high-profile trial as a business opportunity, some saw it as a nuisance and some saw it as an unfortunate situation that has landed in Walterboro, the county seat for Colleton, where the murders took place.|
|But none saw it as a threat.|
|The different emotional reaction between folks in Hampton and those in Walterboro is what really jumped out at me. I didn’t perceive fear in Walterboro the way I did in Hampton.|
|Then I encountered the exception that proved the rule.|
|My interviews done and a storm rolling in, I was just about to jump in my car when I saw a friendly-seeming man in an apron come out of a florist’s shop. He looked to be the owner of the small business, so I asked him how he was preparing for the upcoming crowd.|
|He said he wasn’t doing anything. *“I don’t think anybody’s going to be needing flowers,”* he said.|
|Then he told me something totally unexpected: He lived on Moselle Road, just down the way from the Murdaughs’ hunting estate.|
|He remembered the night Maggie and Paul Murdaugh died. He’d heard what he called *“a wall of sirens”* in the dark night.|
|Not long after, police came knocking on his door.|
|They hoped he’d have a surveillance camera that might’ve recorded what happened.|
|As it turned out, he did have such a camera … but it had been turned off, and so he couldn’t provide information.|
|Now, here’s what really got me. His reaction wasn’t disappointment that he couldn’t help identify the perpetrator, but relief.|
| *“I’d be killed,”* he said.|
|In that instance, he looked less like the welcoming hosts in Walterboro, and more like the folks I’d talked to in Hampton, strained and uncomfortable, backing away.|

|Over the past 18 months, state investigators have indicted disgraced former attorney Alex Murdaugh 19 times. The state grand jury has leveled nearly 100 criminal charges against him, alleging everything from insurance fraud and theft to money laundering and drug trafficking.|
|But to date, federal prosecutors haven’t lodged a single charge against the once-respected Hampton lawyer, even though he played a central role in the federal fraud trial of former Palmetto State Bank CEO Russell Laffitte in November.|
|Laffitte was convicted on all six charges, most of which alleged he helped Murdaugh steal from their mutual clients. That has left close followers of this high-profile case wondering when the feds will charge and prosecute Murdaugh himself.|
|Spoiler alert: They probably won’t.|
|I should couch this by saying that this could always change as the Murdaugh saga twists and turns and as circumstances evolve. But as things stand, I don’t expect federal prosecutors to charge Murdaugh.|
|There are a few things at play here.|
|One is the frosty relationship between the S.C. Attorney General’s Office – the state – and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for South Carolina – the feds.|
|Those two offices have worked together on plenty of cases in the past, including investigations into crooked sheriffs and the $9 billion V.C. Summer nuclear fiasco.|
|But their relationship has also been fraught with behind-the-scenes turf wars over who gets to indict whom, who goes first in prosecuting, and who gets the credit.|
|As I understand it, the Attorney General’s Office has laid exclusive claim to the prosecution of Alex Murdaugh. That means the state will handle the double-murder case, Murdaugh’s financial crimes, his alleged drug trafficking and money laundering – all of it.|
|Everyone agreed long ago that federal prosecutors would tackle the Laffitte portion of the investigation, I’m told.|
|I don’t expect that agreed-upon division of labor in this case to change. So just as I don’t suspect the feds will prosecute Murdaugh, I also don’t expect the state to take their own charges against Laffitte to trial.|
|Another factor at play here is the Petite policy. While it isn’t an enforceable rule or law, the U.S. Department of Justice generally doesn’t follow the state in prosecuting a defendant for the same criminal acts unless there is some compelling reason for the federal government to get involved.|
|There are a few reasons for that policy, the product of a 1960 U.S. Supreme Court case – Petite vs. the United States – where double jeopardy became a major issue.|
|The policy is meant to save prosecutorial resources and protect defendants from the financial burden of going through multiple trials for the same conduct.|
|It is also supposed to promote better coordination and cooperation between state and federal prosecutor.|
|Those two sides are supposed to get together at some point during the course of a joint investigation and decide who is best suited to charging and prosecuting the crimes in question.|
|Federal prosecutors typically prefer to be invited into these kinds of cases, rather than barging in and bigfooting their state counterparts.|
|However, as I mentioned earlier, there are a few scenarios that constitute a “compelling reason” for the federal government to enter a case like this.|
|A few hypotheticals:|
|-The state charges and prosecutes the defendant but doesn’t win a conviction at trial.|
|-The state tries the case but only wins convictions on some of the charges - and not others that allege substantial wrongdoing.|
|-The state reaches a plea deal that the feds believe is too lenient.|
|-The state wins a conviction, but the judge awards a sentence that is too light.|
|-The state’s case falls apart before trial, and they can’t prosecute it on their own.|
|If any of those scenarios play out in the Murdaugh financial cases, we might see the feds get more involved.|
|Otherwise, their role appears to be as a backstop for the case – in which they can jump in and seek more punishment if they believe Murdaugh is getting off easy.|
|I don’t think anyone expects that will be the case.|

| A front row seat to history … |
| *“Who is the woman in the racing jacket?”* |
|That’s been among the most popular questions I’ve received from members of our audience during the ongoing double homicide trial of disbarred attorney/ accused killer Alex Murdaugh – the man at the center of the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|After people inquire as to the identity of the “woman with the jacket” – which is adorned with numerous NASCAR patches – there is the inevitable follow-up question: How did she get such a great seat in the courtroom|
|The woman in the racing jacket is Jean Langston, a Lowcountry artist who has spent more than two decades teaching art to students in Hampton and Colleton counties. I had the pleasure of meeting Langston during a recent trip to the Artists’ Hub of the ACE Basin (a.k.a. AHAB) in downtown Walterboro. Located a block away from the courthouse (at 255 E. Washington Street), AHAB is an arts’ cafe that serves up coffee and confection along with all manner of local creativity – including several handmade retail knickknacks and a stage for aspiring musicians. Looking for an afternoon caffeine infusion? Or a souvenir from your visit to ‘the ‘Boro?” AHAB has got you covered …|
|Seated at a table inside this unique space I found Langston, whose story adorns the front page of the latest print edition of The Walterboro Press and Standard. *“I’m using my own sick days to try and improve myself as an artist,”* Langston told me of her multiple visits to the Colleton County courthouse, where she has been sketching Murdaugh and other key players in the still-unfolding ‘Trial of the Century.’|
|Langston has had an amazing view of the proceedings. When the jury is present, she has been seated directly across from them on the east side of the courtroom – right next to the CourtTV camera and audio operators. This vantage point has afforded her an unrivaled, unobstructed view of Murdaugh as he stands trial for the murders of his wife and son. *“It’s been interesting,”* Langston told me. *“It’s kinda crazy watching all the tears come out of him. It’s like why are you crying … did you do it?”* |
|Langston said she hasn’t made up her mind about Murdaugh’s guilt or innocence, but as she has sketched him she’s been making mental notes about the moments during the proceedings when he has shown emotion. *“He’s crying about the bullet shells – why are you crying about the bullet shells?”* she wondered. *“You’re looking at the (Murdaugh) family sitting behind him – it’s hard for them,”* she continued. *“You know they don’t know either … they’re trying to find out, too.”* |
|Langston told me the evidence of financial crimes committed by Murdaugh has been extremely compelling – an interesting observation considering this evidence has just been deemed admissible by S.C. circuit court judge judge Clifton Newman. *“I mean he stole all this money,”* she said.|
|She told me she also couldn’t help but take note of the testimony of Jan Malinowski, the president of Palmetto State Bank who told the court about Murdaugh running up a negative balance of more than $350,000. *“I get in trouble if I have a $35 overdraft fee,”* she said.|
|Langston told me she is planning to sell her work on EBay after the trial – and might reach out to some of the attorneys she has sketched to see if they are interested in her originals She also told me she’s available for commission work.|
|As for AHAB, this 501(c)3 nonprofit – which exists to support fellow *“artists/ crafters/ musicians”* – reminded me of the local creativity I saw on display during a recent visit to Hampton, S.C., the home of the Murdaugh dynasty. It also served as another example of the city of Walterboro showcasing its local talent as it continues to play the role of inviting, accommodating host to the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century.’|

| WALTERBORO — Forensic scientists found copious amounts of gunshot residue inside a jacket Alex Murdaugh allegedly stashed at his parents’ house just days after the former attorney’s wife and son were shot to death, jurors learned.|
| State Law Enforcement Division analyst Megan Fletcher testified Feb. 7 she couldn’t say how or when the residue particles got on the jacket’s interior — just that they were so numerous it would have taken a week to analyze them all. But in closing his questioning, state prosecutor John Meadors offered a theory: Perhaps the blue rain jacket had been wrapped around a recently shot firearm. Fletcher testified that could explain it. The jacket is a controversial yet key piece of evidence in the state’s ongoing effort to prove Murdaugh fatally shot his wife, Maggie, and son Paul in June 2021 at the family’s Colleton County hunting estate. Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters touted the jacket in his opening statement, alleging Murdaugh, 54, tried to hide it as state investigators searched for the killer.|
| Twenty months after the slayings, investigators still haven’t recovered the shotgun used to kill 22-year-old Paul or the .300 Blackout semiautomatic rifle that took down Maggie, 52. But prosecutors have suggested one or more of the weapons could have been stored within the blue rain jacket in the aftermath of the shootings. Murdaugh’s defense team spent the past two days trying to discredit the jacket theory and prevent jurors from ever hearing about SLED’s gunshot residue analysis. Defense attorney Jim Griffin argued the state has no evidence or testimony even linking Murdaugh to the jacket.|
| The state’s only witness to do so, a caregiver for Murdaugh’s elderly mother, gave testimony that was so contradictory and confusing that state prosecutors and Murdaugh’s legal team were left arguing for two days about what she actually said. Shelley Smith testified Feb. 6 that in the days after the killings, Alex Murdaugh paid an unusual 6:30 a.m. visit to his parents’ house. He was carrying something blue — what looked like bundled tarp — and took it upstairs, Smith initially said.|
|When prosecutors showed Smith a photo of the rain jacket, stashed in an upstairs closet, Smith said that appeared to be the object she described.|
|But when Griffin questioned Smith, she repeatedly said she saw Murdaugh carrying a tarp. Smith testified she was positive it wasn’t a rain jacket, though she never saw it unfolded. On Feb. 7, Judge Clifton Newman settled the debate — at least for now — by allowing the state to proceed with its blue jacket theory. He agreed with prosecutors that it should be up to the jury to vet the state’s case.|
| *“Certainly, Mr. Griffin did an effective job in cross-examination and raising questions as to the credibility of the witness,”* Newman said.|
|With that ruling in hand, prosecutors presented Fletcher as their 35th witness of the three-week trial and the final of the day. Fletcher, the SLED scientist, testified she also found small amounts of gunshot residue particles on Murdaugh and the clothes he wore on the night of the slayings. Using a high-powered microscope and a software program that helps scientists search for gunshot traces, Fletcher said she found one particle on Murdaugh’s hands, three on his white T-shirt, three on his shorts, none on his shoes and one on the seat belt of the Chevrolet Suburban he drove to the crime scene. Fletcher said she could not say how or when the particles got there. They could have resulted from being in close proximity to a gunshot. Or they could have been transferred from another object with residue on it. Gunshot residue can last on an object indefinitely until it is scrubbed off, Fletcher said. SLED is stricter about when it will test for residue on people’s hands, because it tends to rub off on the things they touch within a few hours, even if they don’t wash their hands. |
|In pre-trial motions, Murdaugh’s attorneys have argued the gunshot residue analysis doesn’t implicate him. They say the small number of particles on Murdaugh and his clothes was likely transferred from the 12-gauge shotgun he retrieved from his house for his own protection after finding the bodies of his wife and son shortly after 10 p.m. June 7, 2021.|
|The judge adjourned court Feb. 7 shortly after Meadors wrapped up his initial questioning of Fletcher. Murdaugh’s lawyers will cross-examine her when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Feb 8. Prosecutors on Feb. 7 also began to build their case for the jury that Murdaugh was facing financial scrutiny in the weeks leading up to the killings, including mounting pressure by his own law firm — Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth & Detrick. But at a workplace that employees described as a brotherhood, PMPED’s chief financial officer and one of its partners said those questions quickly took a backseat to supporting Murdaugh as he mourned.|
|Murdaugh’s former law partner, Ronnie Crosby, said he didn’t feel the time was right to talk about money in the days after Maggie and Paul died. PMPED had been pressing Murdaugh for information about legal fees that were unaccounted for; its finance chief, Jeanne Seckinger, confronted Murdaugh about the money hours before the mother and son were killed. *“I trusted him and I said, ‘Let’s just leave it be,’”* Crosby said. Over the course of the trial, Murdaugh’s defense attorneys have noted that the firm backed off its inquiry at least temporarily even before the murders. That’s because Murdaugh learned that day his father was dying. He received that news during Seckinger’s confrontation. |
|Crosby held back tears through long pauses as he answered questions about his relationship with Paul. Crosby gave an eulogy at Paul’s funeral. And he detailed how he and his law partners tried to run down leads and assist the search for the killer. For instance, Crosby said he went to a local mechanic where Paul had taken his Ford F-150 days earlier to see what firearms were inside. He even pulled the shop’s surveillance footage to see if Paul had taken out a rifle like the one his mother appeared to be shot with. (He didn’t see one in the video.) The partners also asked Murdaugh about what he had been doing before the shooting. Murdaugh told them the story he had told investigators: He came home from work early in the evening, rode around his hunting estate with Paul, had dinner with his son and his wife, and fell asleep on the couch while they went to the property’s dog kennels. Then, Murdaugh told them, he went to visit his mother.|
|Asked if Murdaugh mentioned going to the kennels himself, Crosby responded: *“He specifically said that he did not.”* Waters, the lead prosecutor, then played a video recorded on Paul’s cellphone that evening, in which voices are heard in the background discussing a bird the family dog had caught. Prosecutors have said they believe the video was taken minutes before Paul and Maggie died, based on when their cellphone use abruptly ended. Waters asked Crosby whose voices he recognized. *“The three voices on that video are Paul Murdaugh, Maggie Murdaugh and Alex Murdaugh,”* Crosby said. He said he was *“100 percent sure”* of his conclusion, matching what two of Paul’s close friends said in earlier testimony. |

|Repeated reprimands could result in family being booted from proceedings …|
|South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman – the man presiding over the double homicide trial of disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh – has reportedly issued multiple warnings to several members of Murdaugh’s family regarding their behavior in court.|
|As FITSNews exclusively reported on our live feed earlier today, Murdaugh’s family was instructed to move from its front row seat at the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century’ to the back row of seats on the defendant’s side of the Colleton County courthouse. The decision to move the family back by several rows came following *“repeated violations”* of court rules, according to my sources – including improper talking, touching and transferring of items with the defendant. One family member is alleged to have passed an *“undisclosed item”*[^1] to Murdaugh through one of his attorneys – resulting in a court-ordered drug test of the defendant, whose alleged addiction to opioids has become one of the themes of these proceedings.|
|It is not immediately clear when Murdaugh was drug-tested, or what the results of that test were. What happens if the Murdaughs cannot get their acts together? *“The next move for them will be out of the courtroom,”* a source familiar with the situation told me.|
|To be clear: Not all members of the Murdaugh family are causing problems, my sources say. Court officials have reportedly had no issues with either of Alex Murdaugh’s brothers – Randy Murdaugh or John Marvin Murdaugh. *“Randy and John Marvin have conducted themselves as gentlemen,”* a source familiar with the situation told me.|
|In fact, John Marvin Murdaugh has reportedly told court officials he would sit wherever he was asked to sit – or give up his seat inside the courtroom voluntarily. *“The brothers are not the problem,”* another source following the recent reprimands told me.|
|So … who is the problem? According to my sources, Murdaugh’s sister, Lynn Goettee, has refused repeatedly to abide by court rules regarding communication and contact with her brother. Goettee was also identified by courtroom security as the family member who passed Alex Murdaugh the *“undisclosed item.”* Upon being confronted and asked to cease such behavior, Goettee reportedly *“became demonstrative.”*[^1]|
|Buster Murdaugh is also becoming a problem, according to my sources. The surviving son of Alex Murdaugh did not want to be moved back several rows – and is said to have kicked over a water bottle in disgust upon being asked to do so by courthouse security. Buster Murdaugh has also been accused of making an obscene gesture[^1][^2] to one of the witnesses during an in camera session of court earlier this week. Murdaugh allegedly extended his middle finger to attorney Mark Tinsley during his testimony on Monday.|
|Tinsley is the attorney whose lawsuit against the Murdaughs following the 2019 boat crash is believed to have precipitated the collapse of the “House of Murdaugh,” one of the Palmetto State’s most prominent, powerful legal dynasties.|
|The potential removal of certain members of Murdaugh’s family from the courtroom could have long-term implications on these proceedings moving forward. Specifically, it could impact the jury’s impressions of the support Murdaugh may or may not be receiving from his kinfolk. On Thursday morning, for example, Murdaugh attorney Jim Griffin asked Buster and his girlfriend, Brooklynn White, to stand so that a witness he was cross-examining could identify them and discuss what a *“good father”* Murdaugh was. Buster Murdaugh has not spoken publicly about the allegations against his father, although in late November he told a reporter from The (U.K.) Daily Mail he did not want to be portrayed as supporting him. *“I don’t want to see it written anywhere that I’m supporting my father,”* Murdaugh said.|

| [Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Bomb Threat Called Into Courthouse](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/08/murdaugh-murders-saga-bomb-threat-called-into-courthouse/) <br>Building evacuated |
| The threat – which was determined to have been unfounded – prompted an evacuation of the Colleton County courthouse shortly after 12:20 p.m. EST. Court did not resume session until shortly after 3:00 p.m. EST. S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman announced the evacuation of the building at 12:23 p.m. EST during the testimony of special agent Brian Hudak of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Hudak – a computer crimes technician – had just been called to the stand to testify on behalf of the state when Newman called for the building to be cleared. *“Ladies and gentlemen we have to evacuate the building at this time,”* Newman announced calmly. *“So we will be in recess until we discover what’s going on.”* |
|Initial reports indicate the threat was delivered to the courthouse via telephone. According to our sources, the caller told courthouse personnel that a bomb had been placed in judge Newman’s chambers. Sources familiar with the situation said the call came through the main courthouse switchboard, and that SLED is leading the effort to ascertain the identity of the caller(s).|
|K-9 crews with the Colleton County sheriff’s department were spotted entering the building at around 1:00 p.m. EST to investigate the threat. A special bomb unit from SLED was also summoned from nearby Charleston County to assist in the investigation.|
|At 12:55 p.m. EST, SLED public information director Renée Wunderlich issued a statement confirming what happened. *“A bomb threat was received by Colleton County courthouse personnel,”* the statement noted. *“The building has been evacuated and SLED along with the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office are investigating the threat. No additional information is available from SLED at this time.”* |
|Despite no initial indication the threat was credible, law enforcement officers told this news outlet they were taking *“every precaution”* nonetheless. That included an extensive *“sweep”* of the building, which was concluded at approximately 2:30 p.m. EST. Judge Newman reconvened court shortly after 3:00 p.m. EST – two-and-a-half hours after the threat. Of interest? Newman did not address the threat with the jury upon reconvening the proceedings. |

|WALTERBORO — Apparently, it can pay to testify against Alex Murdaugh. That was the message sent Feb. 9 as an online fundraiser set up for Murdaugh family caregiver Shelley Smith collected $13,600 from more than 350 donors — many of them close followers of the high-profile Murdaugh trial who are rooting for his conviction. Smith’s daughter, Rachelle Buckner, set up the GoFundMe campaign after her mother took the witness stand Feb. 6 and offered potentially damaging testimony about Murdaugh’s behavior in the days after his wife, Maggie, and son Paul were shot to death in June 2021 at the family’s hunting compound. The fundraiser sparked controversy and rankled Murdaugh’s defense team, which attempted to have one of the state’s star witnesses disqualified for donating to it. The campaign also sparked a debate in the court of public opinion about the ethics of crowdsourcing donations to a witness in a criminal trial, especially one who is still under subpoena and could theoretically be called back to the stand. The kerfuffle led the campaign’s organizers to delete their original lengthy explainer of the fundraiser, which praised Smith for her bravery in testifying against the 54-year-old former Hampton attorney. They replaced it with a two-sentence description making clear Smith had no role in launching the campaign.|
|The debate played out as the 14th day of proceedings focused squarely on Murdaugh’s alleged financial crimes. Prosecutors contend these purported crimes drove the now-disbarred attorney to violence. Their theory is that Murdaugh killed his wife and son to disrupt inquiries into his troubled finances. Jurors heard from one of Murdaugh’s alleged victims, who described being deceived by him; a bank executive who detailed his mounting debts; an attorney he allegedly duped into helping him steal from his law firm; and another lawyer who was digging into his finances in the weeks before the killings.|
|All had testified last week to these very events during a hearing held outside the jury’s presence. So, many following the case closely found themselves drawn into the controversy over the campaign to aid caregiver Smith that showed donations piling up by the hour. Smith’s testimony was a flashpoint in the trial this week. She delivered emotional and revelatory testimony about the defendant, whose Colleton County murder trial has stretched three weeks so far and captivated national attention. It seemed to pain Smith to testify. She cried and struggled to speak clearly at times. Her testimony was sometimes confusing and occasionally contradictory. She described the Murdaugh family, including Alex, as good people. She said she was sorry *“all of this happened.”* Yet Smith helped state prosecutors build their case that Murdaugh fatally shot his wife and son before working quickly to cover up evidence of his alleged involvement. Smith testified Murdaugh paid an unusual late-night visit to his mother on the night of the killings and stayed with her for 20 minutes as she slept. Murdaugh’s visit was a crucial part of the alibi he initially gave police: that he had left home to see her that evening and returned to find his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and son Paul, 22, shot dead. Smith said she saw Murdaugh several times in the days after the slayings, as investigators hunted for whoever killed Maggie and Paul. Once, she said, Murdaugh told her that if anyone asked her, he had stayed with his mother between 35 and 40 minutes. Smith said she knew that wasn’t true: She was sure Murdaugh had been there just 20 minutes. She said the conversation made her so nervous she called her brother, an assistant police chief in Varnville. Smith also testified Murdaugh soon began offering her unsolicited help. Though they had never discussed it before, Murdaugh asked about Smith’s upcoming wedding and offered to help with the expense, she testified. Smith said Murdaugh also mentioned her job at the local school and told her about his connections with important officials there. Perhaps Smith’s most useful testimony for prosecutors is that she saw Murdaugh stash a crumpled-up blue object at his parents’ house about a week after the slayings. Investigators later recovered a blue rain jacket from an upstairs closet in the home. Tests revealed it was covered in gunshot residue.|
|Prosecutors have implied Murdaugh wrapped one or both of the still-missing murder weapons in the coat before trying to hide it at his parents’ house. Smith’s daughter, Buckner, wrote after the court appearance that her mother *“recently had to testify against (Murdaugh) and it had brought much heartache and stress to her.”* *“My mother is the most caring, giving, and selfless person ever,”* Buckner continued. *“She would give the shirt off her back if she could. Since knowing she would have to testify she had gone through so much with the what-ifs, should I, and the I HAVE TO! I want to reward her for her bravery and her honesty as it was one of the hardest things she had to do. We want to show her that she is not alone and we stand behind her 100%!”*
|One of the 330 donors who stand behind Smith is fellow witness Mark Tinsley, an Allendale trial attorney who has spent the past four years suing Murdaugh on behalf of the victims of a fatal 2019 boat crash involving Murdaugh’s late son Paul. At the time of his death, Paul Murdaugh was awaiting trial on drunk boating charges in the crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach. Tinsley donated $1,000 to Smith under his own name before later labeling it *“Anonymous.”* |
|Just before the state called Tinsley to testify as its 43rd witness, one of Murdaugh’s defense attorneys stood and asked Judge Clifton Newman to exclude his testimony. Attorney Phillip Barber said in court that prosecutors confirmed the payment was authentic. Barber called *“the financial payment to a witness in the middle of a trial”* unprecedented. Newman refused to disqualify Tinsley but acknowledged *“that’ll be good fodder for cross-examination,”* in which the defense can try to impeach a witness’ credibility.|
|Barber is expected to cross-examine Tinsley once court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 10. The two sparred earlier in the case as Tinsley took the stand in a limited hearing with the jury excused, with Tinsley repeatedly mocking Barber’s understanding of the law. Reached after court adjourned, Tinsley said he wanted to comment but wasn’t sure it would be appropriate while he is still testifying. *“I don’t know if I can comment,”* Tinsley said. *“But I sure hope he asks me about it on the stand.”* |
|Miller Shealy, a former state and federal prosecutor and current professor at the Charleston School of Law, told The Post and Courier he had never seen a fundraiser for a traumatized witness. But Shealy said he didn’t see anything improper as long as its organizers are truthful and people know where their money is going. *“I have never heard of such a thing, but I don’t have any reason to believe it is improper,”* Shealy said. Shortly after Barber raised the issue with the judge, someone donated $10 to the campaign in his name.|

|The thing about the double homicide trial of disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh – the man at the epicenter of the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga – is that no one really knows how it’s going. A lot of people think they know how it’s going – and aren’t shy about telling you – but the truth is they are no closer to knowing than you or I.|
|The truth resides in the presumably siloed minds of the seventeen Colleton County residents charged with determining Murdaugh’s fate. And unless you’ve Vulcan mind-melded with each of the twelve jurors and five alternates in this case, you’re just … what’s the expression in these parts?|
| *“Whistling Dixie …”* |
|Murdaugh stands accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and is currently standing trial in Walterboro – a town located in the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State, which Murdaugh’s family ran like a fiefdom for more than a century. The convoluted tale surrounding this crime – described by one Pulitzer prize winning author as the *“courtroom equivalent of Russian nesting dolls”* – indeed has more layers than an onion truck. More rabbit holes than a bunny farm. More twists and turns than the blackwater rivers of the ACE basin.
As the Murdaugh trail meanders its way through week three – and I say *“meanders”* because it hardly seems to be in a hurry or entirely sure of where it is going – pressure is mounting on prosecutors to begin presenting more definitive evidence (circumstantial or otherwise) pinpointing Murdaugh as the murderer of his family members.|
|And not just presenting such definitive evidence … but distilling and packaging it into something resembling a cohesive narrative. A narrative a jury can follow. Seriously … the prosecution’s double homicide case against Murdaugh has been more *“all over the map”* than Ferdinand Magellan. And nearly three weeks into it, we are still waiting on witnesses who will tie it all together. Plenty of potentially compelling evidence has been admitted for the jury’s consideration, it’s just been maddeningly discombobulated – as if the state is suffering from some sort of attention deficit disorder. Also, Murdaugh’s attorneys – Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin – have done an effective job thus far poking holes in the evidence that has been presented (and the credibility of the witnesses testifying to it).|
|Furthermore, Harpootlian and Griffin have yet to present their case … using their experts. Even if we take the state’s presently submitted evidence as gospel … *does any of it push the prosecution’s narrative across the red line? The one in which reasonable doubt is removed?* |
|From the beginning of this trial, our daily polls have been unambiguous: Our audience believes Murdaugh is guilty of killing both his wife and son. Guilty by overwhelming margins, in fact.
|But can the state prove it? Can its prosecutors give those seventeen siloed minds something indisputable upon which to unanimously hang their collective hat? Something, perhaps, like the blood spatter evidence everyone talked about before the trial (but which hasn’t been mentioned since judge Clifton Newman gaveled these proceedings to order)?|
|Obviously, Murdaugh is cold busted lying about his alibi on the night of these savage slayings … as multiple witnesses have attested (and will no doubt continue to attest). The fact Murdaugh’s voice can clearly be heard on a recording made at the scene of the crime less than five minutes before the murders is damning. And the fact he lied about it? Doubly damning. Also, we have yet to see Murdaugh’s third and final interview with agents of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) – the one in which he was confronted about his shredded alibi.|
| *But does the fact he lied about his whereabouts prove he is the killer? In fact … has the state offered up anything over the last two-and-a-half weeks fitting that bill?*|
|This week saw the introduction of a blue tarp/ rain jacket – a critical piece of evidence purportedly implicating Murdaugh in the murders. This item – the color of which seems to be the only thing the state’s witness remembered about it – was found coated in gunshot residue in a closet at Murdaugh’s parents’ home in Almeda, S.C. Has the item been definitively linked to Murdaugh, though? And has the state’s theory he used this blue rain jacket to transport the murder weapons from the crime scene even been expressly articulated?|
|The fact we are still asking those questions is the answer, isn’t it? Absent the guns around which this blue rain jacket was allegedly wrapped (and the state is absent the guns, unfortunately) … does this piece of evidence matter?|
|Speaking of things getting wrapped, a recent ruling from judge Newman has allowed the state’s double homicide case to be enveloped by Murdaugh’s myriad alleged financial crimes (a.k.a. his “motive“). I say “alleged” regarding these financial crimes but come on … In immortal words of comedian Dave Chappelle, *“Baretta did that shit.“* |
|In fact, Murdaugh has already confessed judgment in civil court to some of these fleecings – and based on the evidence presented during this trial his attorneys would be committing legal malpractice if they didn’t encourage him to cut a deal on the balance. Facing 99 counts of various theft, fraud and misappropriation totaling nearly $10 million, Murdaugh could go to jail for more than 700 years on these charges alone. And I’d imagine prosecutors would push for the maximum sentence in the event he beats the double murder rap. |
|Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters – who has delivered a virtuoso performance from the opening gavel of these proceedings – has demonstrated with clear and compelling evidence that Murdaugh is guilty as sin of stealing this money. Every penny of it. The theft is there for all to see – in black and white.|
|But again … this is not Murdaugh’s financial trial. This is his double homicide trial.|
|To his credit, Waters has masterfully connected Murdaugh’s financial crimes with the date of the murders – June 7, 2021. He has elicited testimony from multiple witnesses (with more to come) detailing the imminent collapse of Murdaugh’s financial ‘House of Cards’ – which stood for more than a decade before being detected by employees at his law firm. Waters has also adeptly tied the date of the murders to a June 10, 2021 hearing in a high-profile (and ongoing) wrongful death case involving Murdaugh – a looming legal action which not only threatened to expose his fraud but threatened to expose him and his family to significant additional liability.|
|This *“pressure cooker”* theory is entirely plausible. Eminently probable, even. But as day fourteen of this double homicide trial dawns, the state does not appear to have met the burden of proving his guilt in the murders beyond a reasonable doubt. Not yet, anyway … Can they? We shall see … but as this trial approaches what many believe to be its mid-point, the prosecution is now very much in the *“pressure cooker.”* |

|Another witness accuses Alex Murdaugh of attempting to plant narratives regarding the night of the murders …|
|Prosecutors looking to put disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh behind bars for life for the murder of his wife and son picked up some significant momentum during questioning on Friday morning. And let’s be honest … that momentum came at a pivotal moment for the state in its heretofore directionally challenged case against Murdaugh.
|On Friday morning, assistant attorney general John Meadors questioned former Murdaugh housekeeper Blanca Simpson about her interaction with family members before and after the murders. Among other things, Simpson testified that Maggie Murdaugh expressed concern about the family’s finances in the aftermath of a 2019 boat crash case brought against multiple defendants by attorney Mark Tinsley (who testified earlier in the day). According to Simpson, Maggie Murdaugh said her husband was aware of the amount of money being sought in connection with that case – an estimated $30 million – but felt he wasn’t being truthful with her about it. Simpson testified Maggie was crying and told her *“we don’t have that kind of money.”* However, she also testified that Maggie said if she could give away everything she had in order to make the case go away, she would. *“I would do it in a heartbeat, I’ll start over,”* Maggie told Simpson, according to the latter’s testimony. *“We will start over.”* |
|Obviously, the family never got that chance …|
|In her most compelling testimony, Simpson told enraptured jurors that Murdaugh attempted to convince her after the fact that he was wearing a different shirt than the one he was wearing on the night of the double homicide. This conversation reportedly took place in August of 2021 – shortly after Murdaugh had been confronted by officers of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) about his alibi being shredded by a video filmed by his late son Paul less than five minutes before he was murdered.|
| *"B, I need to talk to you. Come here and sit down,”* Murdaugh allegedly told Simpson. She said the accused killer indicated he had a *“bad feeling”* and that *“something wasn’t right.”* According to her testimony, Simpson said Murdaugh told her a video had been discovered – and asked if she remembered a him wearing *“Vineyard Vines”* shirt on the evening of the murders. *“You know … I was wearing that shirt that day,”* Murdaugh allegedly told her. Simpson testified she didn’t respond to Murdaugh because she was taken aback by his attempt to plant this information in her head. According to her, she remembered fixing his collar on that fateful day – and that he was wearing a “sea foam” colored polo shirt that was not manufactured by Vineyard Vines.|
|What made Simpson’s testimony so compelling? For starters, she is the second witness to allege that Murdaugh attempted to plant a particular narrative related to his alibi in her head. On Monday, a former caregiver to Murdaugh’s mother – Mushelle “Shelley” Smith – told jurors she saw the accused killer cradling a blue tarp/ rain jacket as he went into the upstairs of his parents’ home at Almeda, S.C. several days after the murders. A blue rain jacket was later found wadded up in an upstairs closet inside that home – coated in copious amounts of gunshot residue. Smith also claimed Murdaugh attempted to convince her after the murders that he had been at his parents’ home for 30-40 minutes – not the 15-20 minutes she recalled. Smith’s recollection of the timeline of the night of the murders also contradicted what Murdaugh told investigators – and her testimony appears to be supported by vehicular data obtained from Murdaugh’s Chevrolet Suburban.|

|Mark Tinsley fires back at Alex Murdaugh’s attorneys …|
|In a trial littered with explosive developments – and plenty of ancillary drama – the great “GoFundMe” controversy of attorney Mark Tinsley is likely to wind up as a mere footnote. Still, this is the ‘Murdaugh Murders‘ crime and corruption saga – and anything tied to it (no matter how seemingly insignificant) causes considerable churning on the interwebs. On Thursday, attorneys representing disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh moved to strike Tinsley’s testimony because the attorney donated $1,000 to a GoFundMe page established by family members of Mushelle “Shelley” Smith. Smith, our audience will recall, provided some significant testimony earlier this week related to Murdaugh’s movements on the night of the June 7, 2021 – when prosecutors allege he savagely murdered two of his family members on their hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. Tinsley has also provided compelling testimony in this case – giving jurors insight into the 2019 boat crash case involving Murdaugh’s family that exposed the defendant to significant personal liability.|
|Prosecutors have maintained the threat of Tinsley’s lawsuit helped push Murdaugh over the edge – especially considering there was a scheduled hearing in this case on June 10, 2021, one which threatened to expose the many financial crimes he is currently staring down.|
|Smith testified on Monday of this week, telling jurors she saw Murdaugh cradling a blue tarp/ rain jacket as he walked to the upstairs of his parents’ home at Almeda, S.C. several days after the murders. A blue rain jacket was later found wadded up in an upstairs closet inside that home – coated in copious amounts of gunshot residue. Smith’s recollection of the timeline of the night of the murders also contradicted what Murdaugh told investigators – and her testimony appears to be supported by vehicular data obtained from Murdaugh’s Chevrolet Suburban. Smith was clearly rattled during her testimony – appearing torn between the truth and her loyalty to the Murdaugh family. She also appeared to be an extremely compelling witness based on the jury’s response to her testimony.|
|As for Tinsley, he bristled at the suggestion his donation was improper – accusing Murdaugh attorney Phil Barber of *“pandering to the cameras.”* *“The suggestion of impropriety by me donating to a GoFundMe created for a deserving, hardworking lady was just him pandering to the cameras I think,”* Tinsley told me. *“I hope a lot more people help her.”* Despite his vocal objection to Tinsley’s donation, Barber did not raise the issue during his brief cross-examination of Tinsley on Friday morning.|

|WALTERBORO — In the aftermath of the brutal shootings of his wife and son, Alex Murdaugh reportedly worked to make sure his story of that night matched that of potential witnesses in the case. Days after the slayings, Murdaugh approached one of his mother’s caregivers, Shelley Smith, and asserted he had visited his mother between 35 and 40 minutes the night of June 7, 2021. Smith testified Feb. 6 that the conversation unnerved her. She said she knew he had been there just 20 minutes.|
|Two months later, the prominent Hampton attorney had a similar conversation with his family’s housekeeper, Blanca Simpson. It was August, shortly after an interview in which state investigators had asked Murdaugh point-blank whether he killed Maggie and Paul. Prosecutors have used witnesses like Smith and Simpson to bolster their theory Murdaugh, 54, killed his wife and son and worked quickly to cover up his involvement. Smith and Simpson knew Murdaugh well, having worked for his family for years. They described Murdaugh’s behavior after the slayings as unusual.|
|The Murdaugh family, a four-generation clan of lawyers who wielded immense influence in the state’s 14th Judicial Circuit, has been accused of seeking to influence witnesses before. In the hours after the 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach, Murdaugh and his late father, Randolph Murdaugh III, went to the Beaufort County hospital and persuaded the crash’s survivors not to talk to investigators, witnesses told law enforcement. Paul Murdaugh, then 19, was charged with drunkenly driving the boat when it crashed, charges that were dropped after his death. The state grand jury reportedly launched an investigation into possible obstruction of justice in that investigation.|
|Simpson was the state’s star witness on Feb. 10, one of 47 they have called over the trial’s first three weeks. She provided what could prove critical testimony about what Murdaugh wore on June 7, 2021 — a question of great intrigue during the trial. rosecutors showed Simpson a Snapchat video Paul filmed on his phone at 7:38 p.m. It depicts his father wearing a seafoam-colored short-sleeve shirt, khakis and loafers as he tends to a flimsy tree. But when investigators arrived at the crime scene later that evening, Murdaugh wore a white T-shirt, green cargo shorts and yellow sneakers. First responders testified Murdaugh appeared clean — his clothes seemed freshly laundered — even though he told dispatchers and investigators he had tried to check his wife and son’s gore-drenched bodies for signs of life. Murdaugh’s defense attorneys have repeatedly pointed out that investigators searched every room of the Murdaughs’ home and never found any bloody clothes or evidence the killer had cleaned up there. Simpson testified she found Murdaugh’s khaki pants on the bathroom floor when she arrived at the family’s Moselle estate the morning after the slayings. Murdaugh had asked her to tidy up the way Maggie, 52, would’ve liked it, she testified. Simpson threw the pants and a damp towel she found into the wash, not realizing they might have been useful evidence in the homicide investigation. Simpson had been at the Murdaugh’s estate for a while on June 8 before State Law Enforcement Division agents arrived to search the house, she said. Simpson testified investigators didn’t ask her any questions that day, and she said nothing to them. |
|In cross-examination, Murdaugh attorney Dick Harpootlian asked whether Simpson had already picked up the pants and towel by the time SLED arrived. Simpson said she hadn’t, and the items would’ve been there for agents to see. Simpson established in her testimony she knew where every piece of clothing the Murdaughs’ owned belonged in their closet. She had run them through the wash over and over. |
|Meadors asked her about the shirt and shoes Murdaugh wore in the Snapchat video. Did she ever see them again after the slayings? *“No, sir,”* Simpson said. Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters told Judge Clifton Newman he expects the state to rest its case Feb. 15. After that, the defense team will call its own witnesses. Some of them are technical experts, and others are Murdaugh’s relatives, several of whom have appeared in court every day of the trial to support the now-disbarred attorney.|
