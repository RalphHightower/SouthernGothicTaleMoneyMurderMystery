| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Prosecution Scores Huge Admissibility Win](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/06/murdaugh-murders-saga-prosecution-scores-huge-admissibility-win/)<br>Judge insists evidence of financial crimes is *“more probative than prejudicial.”*<br>Prosecutors seeking to put disbarred attorney/ accused killer Alex Murdaugh behind bars for life scored a major win on Monday when South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman ruled they could call witnesses, elicit testimony and introduce evidence related to various financial crimes of which Murdaugh stands accused.<br>
Murdaugh allegedly killed his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty and is currently standing trial in Walterboro, S.C. – part of the five-county Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his family once ran like a fiefdom. In addition to this double homicide, Murdaugh is facing 99 individual charges related to *“schemes to defraud victims”* of nearly $10 million.|
|Prosecutors claim the potential exposure of Murdaugh’s financial crimes were a possible motive for murder – making this evidence admissible under Rule 404(b) of the South Carolina rules of criminal procedure. According to that rule, evidence of *“other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person.”* However, the rule does permit such *“prior bad acts”* to be admitted in order *“to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.”* |
|Newman concluded the state had met the threshold for the admission of this evidence, saying *“the jury is entitled to hear whether the apparent desperation of Murdaugh due to his dire financial situation and threat of being exposed”* was his motive for murder. *“This evidence is admissible,”* Newman ruled, arguing the evidence was *“more probative than prejudicial”* and would *“aid the jury in understanding the context in which the crime occurred.”* Newman’s ruling paves the way for jurors to hear testimony from multiple witnesses who have already provided incriminating testimony against Murdaugh outside the presence of the jury.|
|Those witnesses include …|
|Carson Burney: Auditor with the S.C. Department of Revenue (SCDOR) who assisted the statewide grand jury in tracing monies allegedly stolen by Murdaugh from a variety of sources.|
Michael Gunn: Principal of Forge Consulting, a company Alex Murdaugh appears to have mimicked in an effort to fleece proceeds from legal settlements.|
|Jan Malinowski: President and chief executive officer of Palmetto State Bank. Malinowski’s predecessor, Russell Laffitte, has already been convicted of conspiring with Murdaugh to steal millions of dollars from his former clients.|
|Tony Satterfield: Son of Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh’s former housekeeper whose suspicious 2018 death led to a multi-million dollar settlement from Alex Murdaugh’s insurance providers. Murdaugh allegedly stole those settlement proceeds from Tony and his brother. In fact, Murdaugh has already confessed judgment in connection with the Satterfield case.|
|Jeanne Seckinger: The comptroller of Murdaugh’s former law firm, Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth and Detrick (PMPED). Seckinger confronted Murdaugh about missing fees from a PMPED account on the day of the murders. She testified Murdaugh shot her a *“glare”* she had never seen before in more than two decades of working with him.|
|Mark Tinsley: The lead attorney in the 2019 boat crash case that claimed the life of 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. Tinsley was suing Murdaugh in connection with his wrongful death action on behalf of Beach’s family, and a hearing was scheduled for June 10, 2021 regarding a motion to compel the production of Murdaugh’s financial information. Murdaugh was working a response to that motion on the day of the murders.|
|Chris Wilson: Murdaugh’s best friend and a fellow attorney who worked several cases with him. Wilson testified that Murdaugh stole nearly $200,000 from him in the days leading up to the murders – and acknowledged this theft months later.|

|WALTERBORO — In the coming days of Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial, jurors will hear testimony accusing the once-prominent Hampton lawyer of secretly stealing millions of dollars from friends, family, clients and others who trusted him for the better part of a decade.<br>Judge Clifton Newman on Feb. 6 decided evidence of those alleged financial crimes could be admitted as Murdaugh stands trial on charges of fatally shooting his wife, Maggie, and son Paul in June 2021 at the family’s hunting estate.|
|Newman’s ruling was a major victory for the S.C. Attorney General’s Office, which for nearly two months has said Murdaugh’s alleged financial wrongdoing is central to its theory of the case. The judge’s decision also will extend the length of the trial taking place at the Colleton County Courthouse. Proceedings were initially expected to wrap up this week. Now, the end of the trial is no longer in sight.|
|Newman’s ruling resolves a protracted dispute between prosecutors and Murdaugh’s legal team. The legal decision also could give Murdaugh, 54, grounds for an appeal if he is convicted. 
Defense attorneys contend the financial evidence is prejudicial and unrelated to the crimes charged in this case. They argue that prosecutors can’t prove Murdaugh killed his wife and son, so they need to show the jury he is a bad guy who deserves punishment.|
|But prosecutors say the evidence provides Murdaugh’s motive for the slayings. They hope to show jurors Murdaugh knew on June 7, 2021, that his misdeeds were going to be exposed. With his career and reputation on the line, Murdaugh that evening used both a rifle and a shotgun to eliminate his 52-year-old wife and son, 22, prosecutors allege. They say he did so to portray himself as the victim of an “unspeakable tragedy” and to buy time for a cover up. The prosecution’s strategy is not without risks. The alleged financial crimes give the jury a tangible reason to explain why Murdaugh would kill his wife and son. But the swirl of numbers, bank ledgers and custodial witnesses could also risk confusing jurors already navigating a complicated narrative in the case. In announcing his decision, Newman cited testimony from some of the seven witnesses who have testified with the jury excused from the courtroom — about Murdaugh’s thefts and betrayals. Now, those witnesses could return to the stand to tell their stories again, this time for the jury to hear.|
|Among them was Jeanne Seckinger, the chief financial officer of Murdaugh’s former law firm — the Hampton legal institution founded by his great-grandfather. Seckinger testified that she confronted Murdaugh, hours before the murders, over $792,000 in missing legal fees from a case he had worked.|
|Hampton-based Palmetto State Bank would have stopped loaning Murdaugh money and allowing him to overdraft his accounts if it had known Murdaugh was stealing from his legal clients and law partners, bank CEO Jan Malinoski testified last week.|
|On Feb. 6, Allendale attorney Mark Tinsley testified about his efforts in spring 2021 to force Murdaugh to reveal details of his bank records. Tinsley was suing the Murdaugh family on behalf of the parents of Mallory Beach, who died in a 2019 boat crash in Beaufort County. Paul Murdaugh, before his death, was awaiting trial on accusations he was drunk and slammed the boat into a bridge piling at Parris Island, resulting in her death. Tinsley wanted financial disclosures to verify Alex Murdaugh’s claim he was broke and had little money to pay the Beach family in a wrongful death settlement. |
|Prosecutors say those records would have laid bare Murdaugh’s shaky finances and his practice of stealing money to cover his massive debts. A hearing on whether Murdaugh would be forced to hand over his financial records was scheduled for June 10, 2021. It was canceled after the Murdaugh family slayings.|
| *“If the hearing takes place on June 10, 2021, what is the net effect of what could happen with that?”* lead prosecutor Creighton Waters asked. *“The discovery of everything he’s done,”* Tinsley said.|
|The ruling to admit evidence of Murdaugh’s alleged financial crimes resolved one fight in the double murder trial. Another conflict emerged immediately thereafter. This one centers on one of the few pieces of physical evidence introduced by prosecutors that could have a direct link to the killings.|
|Prosecutors want jurors to hear about a blue rain jacket investigators seized from the house of Murdaugh’s parents, which they say showed high levels of gunshot residue. Defense lawyers say prosecutors can’t link the jacket to their client. Prosecutors so far have relied on a single witness to do so; her testimony Feb. 6 caused more confusion than clarity.|
|Mushelle “Shelley” Smith, who was a caregiver for Murdaugh’s mother in 2021, said Murdaugh arrived early one morning in the days after the killings, which was unusual. He was cradling what appeared to be a blue tarp, she said. Investigators didn’t learn about the tarp for months. Smith said the first time she mentioned it to police was when she was chatting with an Allendale officer after a car wreck. Allendale police notified the State Law Enforcement Division, which searched the home of Murdaugh’s parents in September 2021. They found a blue tarp in a plastic storage tub in one closet and an oversized blue rain jacket crumpled in the back of another, SLED agent Kristin Moore testified. The poncho-style jacket was so large that Moore had to reach out her arms to hold it up. Prosecutors suggested its size could lead someone to mistake it for a tarp. It isn’t clear which, if either, of those items Smith claims to have seen Murdaugh carrying.|
|When prosecutors showed her a photo of the rain jacket in the back of the closet, she said it looked like what she saw Murdaugh carrying that morning. Defense attorney Jim Griffin later showed her a photo of the jacket laid out. At that point, she said it didn’t look like what Murdaugh brought to the house. The uncertainty over Smith’s testimony came to a head at the end of the day Feb. 6, when defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian asked Newman to bar testimony about gunshot residue found on the jacket. He argued that Smith, the only person connecting the jacket to Murdaugh, testified she didn’t see him with it.|
|Waters, the lead prosecutor, said her testimony established a connection. Unable to agree on what Smith said, Harpootlian suggested Newman pull a transcript of her testimony.|
|The issue is likely to be discussed further Feb. 7, when the SLED lab analyst who ran gunshot residue tests is expected to testify.|

| [Local Artist Capturing ‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/07/local-artist-capturing-murdaugh-murders-trial/) |
| A front row seat to history … |
| *“Who is the woman in the racing jacket?”* |
|That’s been among the most popular questions I’ve received from members of our audience during the ongoing double homicide trial of disbarred attorney/ accused killer Alex Murdaugh – the man at the center of the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|After people inquire as to the identity of the “woman with the jacket” – which is adorned with numerous NASCAR patches – there is the inevitable follow-up question: How did she get such a great seat in the courtroom|
|The woman in the racing jacket is Jean Langston, a Lowcountry artist who has spent more than two decades teaching art to students in Hampton and Colleton counties. I had the pleasure of meeting Langston during a recent trip to the Artists’ Hub of the ACE Basin (a.k.a. AHAB) in downtown Walterboro. Located a block away from the courthouse (at 255 E. Washington Street), AHAB is an arts’ cafe that serves up coffee and confection along with all manner of local creativity – including several handmade retail knickknacks and a stage for aspiring musicians. Looking for an afternoon caffeine infusion? Or a souvenir from your visit to ‘the ‘Boro?” AHAB has got you covered …|
|Seated at a table inside this unique space I found Langston, whose story adorns the front page of the latest print edition of The Walterboro Press and Standard. *“I’m using my own sick days to try and improve myself as an artist,”* Langston told me of her multiple visits to the Colleton County courthouse, where she has been sketching Murdaugh and other key players in the still-unfolding ‘Trial of the Century.’|
|Langston has had an amazing view of the proceedings. When the jury is present, she has been seated directly across from them on the east side of the courtroom – right next to the CourtTV camera and audio operators. This vantage point has afforded her an unrivaled, unobstructed view of Murdaugh as he stands trial for the murders of his wife and son. *“It’s been interesting,”* Langston told me. *“It’s kinda crazy watching all the tears come out of him. It’s like why are you crying … did you do it?”* |
|Langston said she hasn’t made up her mind about Murdaugh’s guilt or innocence, but as she has sketched him she’s been making mental notes about the moments during the proceedings when he has shown emotion. *“He’s crying about the bullet shells – why are you crying about the bullet shells?”* she wondered. *“You’re looking at the (Murdaugh) family sitting behind him – it’s hard for them,”** she continued. “You know they don’t know either … they’re trying to find out, too.”*|
|Langston told me the evidence of financial crimes committed by Murdaugh has been extremely compelling – an interesting observation considering this evidence has just been deemed admissible by S.C. circuit court judge judge Clifton Newman. *“I mean he stole all this money,”* she said.|
|She told me she also couldn’t help but take note of the testimony of Jan Malinowski, the president of Palmetto State Bank who told the court about Murdaugh running up a negative balance of more than $350,000. *“I get in trouble if I have a $35 overdraft fee,”* she said.|
|Langston told me she is planning to sell her work on EBay after the trial – and might reach out to some of the attorneys she has sketched to see if they are interested in her originals She also told me she’s available for commission work.|
|As for AHAB, this 501(c)3 nonprofit – which exists to support fellow *“artists/ crafters/ musicians”* – reminded me of the local creativity I saw on display during a recent visit to Hampton, S.C., the home of the Murdaugh dynasty. It also served as another example of the city of Walterboro showcasing its local talent as it continues to play the role of inviting, accommodating host to the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century.’|

| WALTERBORO — Forensic scientists found copious amounts of gunshot residue inside a jacket Alex Murdaugh allegedly stashed at his parents’ house just days after the former attorney’s wife and son were shot to death, jurors learned.|
| State Law Enforcement Division analyst Megan Fletcher testified Feb. 7 she couldn’t say how or when the residue particles got on the jacket’s interior — just that they were so numerous it would have taken a week to analyze them all. But in closing his questioning, state prosecutor John Meadors offered a theory: Perhaps the blue rain jacket had been wrapped around a recently shot firearm. Fletcher testified that could explain it. The jacket is a controversial yet key piece of evidence in the state’s ongoing effort to prove Murdaugh fatally shot his wife, Maggie, and son Paul in June 2021 at the family’s Colleton County hunting estate. Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters touted the jacket in his opening statement, alleging Murdaugh, 54, tried to hide it as state investigators searched for the killer.|
| Twenty months after the slayings, investigators still haven’t recovered the shotgun used to kill 22-year-old Paul or the .300 Blackout semiautomatic rifle that took down Maggie, 52. But prosecutors have suggested one or more of the weapons could have been stored within the blue rain jacket in the aftermath of the shootings. Murdaugh’s defense team spent the past two days trying to discredit the jacket theory and prevent jurors from ever hearing about SLED’s gunshot residue analysis. Defense attorney Jim Griffin argued the state has no evidence or testimony even linking Murdaugh to the jacket.|
| The state’s only witness to do so, a caregiver for Murdaugh’s elderly mother, gave testimony that was so contradictory and confusing that state prosecutors and Murdaugh’s legal team were left arguing for two days about what she actually said. Shelley Smith testified Feb. 6 that in the days after the killings, Alex Murdaugh paid an unusual 6:30 a.m. visit to his parents’ house. He was carrying something blue — what looked like bundled tarp — and took it upstairs, Smith initially said.
When prosecutors showed Smith a photo of the rain jacket, stashed in an upstairs closet, Smith said that appeared to be the object she described.|
|But when Griffin questioned Smith, she repeatedly said she saw Murdaugh carrying a tarp. Smith testified she was positive it wasn’t a rain jacket, though she never saw it unfolded. On Feb. 7, Judge Clifton Newman settled the debate — at least for now — by allowing the state to proceed with its blue jacket theory. He agreed with prosecutors that it should be up to the jury to vet the state’s case.|
| *“Certainly, Mr. Griffin did an effective job in cross-examination and raising questions as to the credibility of the witness,”* Newman said.|
|With that ruling in hand, prosecutors presented Fletcher as their 35th witness of the three-week trial and the final of the day. Fletcher, the SLED scientist, testified she also found small amounts of gunshot residue particles on Murdaugh and the clothes he wore on the night of the slayings. Using a high-powered microscope and a software program that helps scientists search for gunshot traces, Fletcher said she found one particle on Murdaugh’s hands, three on his white T-shirt, three on his shorts, none on his shoes and one on the seat belt of the Chevrolet Suburban he drove to the crime scene. Fletcher said she could not say how or when the particles got there. They could have resulted from being in close proximity to a gunshot. Or they could have been transferred from another object with residue on it. Gunshot residue can last on an object indefinitely until it is scrubbed off, Fletcher said. SLED is stricter about when it will test for residue on people’s hands, because it tends to rub off on the things they touch within a few hours, even if they don’t wash their hands. |
|In pre-trial motions, Murdaugh’s attorneys have argued the gunshot residue analysis doesn’t implicate him. They say the small number of particles on Murdaugh and his clothes was likely transferred from the 12-gauge shotgun he retrieved from his house for his own protection after finding the bodies of his wife and son shortly after 10 p.m. June 7, 2021.|
|The judge adjourned court Feb. 7 shortly after Meadors wrapped up his initial questioning of Fletcher. Murdaugh’s lawyers will cross-examine her when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Feb 8. Prosecutors on Feb. 7 also began to build their case for the jury that Murdaugh was facing financial scrutiny in the weeks leading up to the killings, including mounting pressure by his own law firm — Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth & Detrick. But at a workplace that employees described as a brotherhood, PMPED’s chief financial officer and one of its partners said those questions quickly took a backseat to supporting Murdaugh as he mourned.|
|Murdaugh’s former law partner, Ronnie Crosby, said he didn’t feel the time was right to talk about money in the days after Maggie and Paul died. PMPED had been pressing Murdaugh for information about legal fees that were unaccounted for; its finance chief, Jeanne Seckinger, confronted Murdaugh about the money hours before the mother and son were killed. *“I trusted him and I said, ‘Let’s just leave it be,’”* Crosby said. Over the course of the trial, Murdaugh’s defense attorneys have noted that the firm backed off its inquiry at least temporarily even before the murders. That’s because Murdaugh learned that day his father was dying. He received that news during Seckinger’s confrontation. |
|Crosby held back tears through long pauses as he answered questions about his relationship with Paul. Crosby gave an eulogy at Paul’s funeral. And he detailed how he and his law partners tried to run down leads and assist the search for the killer. For instance, Crosby said he went to a local mechanic where Paul had taken his Ford F-150 days earlier to see what firearms were inside. He even pulled the shop’s surveillance footage to see if Paul had taken out a rifle like the one his mother appeared to be shot with. (He didn’t see one in the video.) The partners also asked Murdaugh about what he had been doing before the shooting. Murdaugh told them the story he had told investigators: He came home from work early in the evening, rode around his hunting estate with Paul, had dinner with his son and his wife, and fell asleep on the couch while they went to the property’s dog kennels. Then, Murdaugh told them, he went to visit his mother.|
|Asked if Murdaugh mentioned going to the kennels himself, Crosby responded: *“He specifically said that he did not.”* Waters, the lead prosecutor, then played a video recorded on Paul’s cellphone that evening, in which voices are heard in the background discussing a bird the family dog had caught. Prosecutors have said they believe the video was taken minutes before Paul and Maggie died, based on when their cellphone use abruptly ended. Waters asked Crosby whose voices he recognized. *“The three voices on that video are Paul Murdaugh, Maggie Murdaugh and Alex Murdaugh,”* Crosby said. He said he was *“100 percent sure”* of his conclusion, matching what two of Paul’s close friends said in earlier testimony. |

| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Alex Murdaugh’s Family Issued Warnings By Court](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/09/murdaugh-murders-saga-alex-murdaughs-family-issued-warnings-by-court/) |
|Repeated reprimands could result in family being booted from proceedings …|
|South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman – the man presiding over the double homicide trial of disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh – has reportedly issued multiple warnings to several members of Murdaugh’s family regarding their behavior in court.|
|As FITSNews exclusively reported on our live feed earlier today, Murdaugh’s family was instructed to move from its front row seat at the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century’ to the back row of seats on the defendant’s side of the Colleton County courthouse. The decision to move the family back by several rows came following *“repeated violations”* of court rules, according to my sources – including improper talking, touching and transferring of items with the defendant. One family member is alleged to have passed an *“undisclosed item”* to Murdaugh through one of his attorneys – resulting in a court-ordered drug test of the defendant, whose alleged addiction to opioids has become one of the themes of these proceedings.|
|It is not immediately clear when Murdaugh was drug-tested, or what the results of that test were. What happens if the Murdaughs cannot get their acts together? *“The next move for them will be out of the courtroom,”* a source familiar with the situation told me.|
|To be clear: Not all members of the Murdaugh family are causing problems, my sources say. Court officials have reportedly had no issues with either of Alex Murdaugh’s brothers – Randy Murdaugh or John Marvin Murdaugh. *“Randy and John Marvin have conducted themselves as gentlemen,”* a source familiar with the situation told me.|
|In fact, John Marvin Murdaugh has reportedly told court officials he would sit wherever he was asked to sit – or give up his seat inside the courtroom voluntarily. *“The brothers are not the problem,”* another source following the recent reprimands told me.|
|So … who is the problem? According to my sources, Murdaugh’s sister, Lynn Goettee, has refused repeatedly to abide by court rules regarding communication and contact with her brother. Goettee was also identified by courtroom security as the family member who passed Alex Murdaugh the *“undisclosed item.”* Upon being confronted and asked to cease such behavior, Goettee reportedly *“became demonstrative.”*|
|Buster Murdaugh is also becoming a problem, according to my sources. The surviving son of Alex Murdaugh did not want to be moved back several rows – and is said to have kicked over a water bottle in disgust upon being asked to do so by courthouse security. Buster Murdaugh has also been accused of making an obscene gesture to one of the witnesses during an in camera session of court earlier this week. Murdaugh allegedly extended his middle finger to attorney Mark Tinsley during his testimony on Monday.|
|Tinsley is the attorney whose lawsuit against the Murdaughs following the 2019 boat crash is believed to have precipitated the collapse of the “House of Murdaugh,” one of the Palmetto State’s most prominent, powerful legal dynasties.|
|The potential removal of certain members of Murdaugh’s family from the courtroom could have long-term implications on these proceedings moving forward. Specifically, it could impact the jury’s impressions of the support Murdaugh may or may not be receiving from his kinfolk. On Thursday morning, for example, Murdaugh attorney Jim Griffin asked Buster and his girlfriend, Brooklynn White, to stand so that a witness he was cross-examining could identify them and discuss what a *“good father”* Murdaugh was. Buster Murdaugh has not spoken publicly about the allegations against his father, although in late November he told a reporter from The (U.K.) Daily Mail he did not want to be portrayed as supporting him. *“I don’t want to see it written anywhere that I’m supporting my father,”* Murdaugh said.|
