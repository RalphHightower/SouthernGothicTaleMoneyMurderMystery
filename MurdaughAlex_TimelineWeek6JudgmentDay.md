| ‘Jury view’ ordered … |
| Newman’s order came in response to a request made Monday morning by Murdaugh’s lead attorney, Dick Harpootlian. According to Harpootlian, *“we believe it would be useful for the jury to visit Moselle – both the area of the kennels and the house – just to get some understanding of spatial relationships.”* “Moselle” is the local name of the Murdaugh family’s 1,700-acre hunting property – which straddles the Salkehatchie River between Hampton and Colleton counties near Islandton, S.C. *“(The jury view) needs to be done in an expeditious way,”* Harpootlian added, referencing the impending conclusion of Murdaugh’s trial which appears on track to be handed to the jury by the end of the week.|
|Murdaugh is the scion of an influential Lowcountry legal dynasty – a man who once led the Palmetto State’s powerful trial lawyers’ lobby. Today, he is in the middle of a maze of alleged criminality known as the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga. In addition to a host of other alleged crimes (many of which he confessed to on the stand last week), Murdaugh is accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and is currently standing trial in Walterboro – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his famous family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century. |
|Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters objected to the field trip request, saying *“the scene is different than it existed on the night of June 7, 2021.”* *“A big factor – which I think is very relevant to some of the issues here – is that the trees that were planted that separate the kennels from the house are markedly taller and thicker than they were on June 7,”* Waters added. Waters also objected to Harpootlian’s suggestion that jurors be allowed to decide for themselves whether to view the scene – saying he had *“never heard”* of a judge granting jurors such authority.|
|Newman wasted little time in granting Harpootlian’s motion. *“Upon request of either side, the court will allow a jury view,”* Newman said. *“If the defense wants a jury view, then the court will arrange a jury view.”* Newman declined to leave the matter up to the jury, though, saying a discussion of whether or not to undertake the field trip *“could invite premature deliberations in the case.”* Newman added he would advise the jury that *“as part of going to the scene, certain things may not be as they were two years ago.”* Harpootlian further requested the court ensure the scene was undisturbed at the time the jury arrived – citing recent allegations of trespassing on the property.|
| *“There were literally dozens of people at Moselle last weekend trespassing to get selfies in front of the feed room, I mean – the most distasteful kinds of things I’ve ever scene,”* Harpootlian said. *“Perhaps before they head out there some security could be (put) in place?”* *“We will have law enforcement secure the scene and ensure no one is there,”* Newman assured Harpootlian. *“The scene will be secure.”* |
|Colleton County deputies were reportedly already hard at work preparing for the field trip. Moselle is under contract to be sold as part of the disposition of Murdaugh’s assets in connection with an ongoing civil complaint. Currently, those assets are under the control of court-appointed receivers. The property is currently being managed by Murdaugh’s brother, John Marvin Murdaugh. |
| **[‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial – Defense Closes Strong](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/27/murdaugh-murders-trial-defense-closes-strong/)** |
|Alex Murdaugh’s brother provides compelling testimony … but prosecutords blast his claim of *“full cooperation”* from family.|
| A little over a week ago, the state of South Carolina rested its case against disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh in dramatic fashion. Last Friday, the state delivered an absolute evisceration of the defendant – who stands accused of murdering his wife and son in cold blood. On Monday, the defense rested … closing its case with compelling testimony from John Marvin Murdaugh, Alex Murdaugh’s youngest brother. John Marvin Murdaugh took the stand at a pivotal moment for his brother … whose decision to testify last week backfired calamitously when lead prosecutor Creighton Waters blew huge holes in his latest (and exponentially less believable) narrative of events from the night of these savage killings.|
|John Marvin Murdaugh testified in graphic detail about what he witnessed in the aftermath of the shooting, describing his brother as *“destroyed”* and *“broken.”* *“I can promise you – words don’t do it justice,”* Murdaugh said of his brother’s state of mind following the killings. *“I would have to create a new word to describe how distraught he was.”* On the day after the killings, Murdaugh said he went down to the kennels where the crime took place to see it for himself. After receiving the all-clear from law enforcement, he said he was shocked by what he witnessed upon entering the feed room. *“I saw blood, I saw brains, I saw pieces of skull,”* Murdaugh testified through sobs. *“It was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through in my life.”* Murdaugh set to work cleaning the crime scene, saying *“no mother, brother, father, uncle … no one should ever have to go through that.”* *“I couldn’t stop,”* he said. *“I had to do it for Paul. For some reason I though it was something I needed to do for Paul.”* John Marvin Murdaugh also said he made a vow to *“find out who did this to him.”* Asked at the conclusion of his testimony by his brother’s attorney, Jim Griffin, whether he believed he had found out who the ‘real killers’ were, Murdaugh responded in the negative. *“I have not,”* he testified.|
|Jurors seemed extremely engaged with Murdaugh’s brother – smiling at him, laughing at his jokes and connecting with him emotionally as he described his personal experiences responding to the tragedy which engulfed his family. But the meat of his testimony was clearly intended to call into question the integrity of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) – the agency tasked with investigating the various Murdaugh-related crimes. Among other things, John Marvin Murdaugh criticized SLED for initially refusing his offer to help locate Maggie Murdaugh’s cell phone on the afternoon after the murders. *“They say they had technology on the way,”* he said. Murdaugh later located the phone with the help of S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor Duffie Stone and investigators from his office (none of whom should have been near the scene given the fact Murdaugh was a badge-carrying assistant in Stone’s office at the time). Murdaugh also accused SLED of misleading him and other family members about the alleged presence of high-velocity impact spatter on the white shirt Murdaugh was wearing when first responders arrived following his 9-1-1 call on the evening of June 7, 2021.|
|The state attempted to keep this testimony off the record, arguing they had not introduced any such evidence at trial. Judge Clifton Newman overruled the objection and allowed John Marvin Murdaugh to continue testifying. Murdaugh was stung on cross-examination, though, as assistant attorney general John Conrad grilled him as to whether his family – and particularly his brother – provided *“full cooperation”* to investigators. This line of cross-examination reinforced the so-called “Big Lie” of this trial – in which a cell phone video recorded by Paul Murdaugh revealed his father’s presence at the scene of the murders less than five minutes before the state contends the shooting began. *“Is that full cooperation?”* Conrad asked Murdaugh about his brother lying to law enforcement about his whereabouts in the moments leading up to killings. *“I would say that yes, he lied,”* Murdaugh answered.|
|Conrad also pressed Murdaugh on his brother’s relationship with Yemassee, S.C. police chief Greg Alexander, a potentially key player in this drama whose name has been dropped on multiple occasions in the past few days of testimony. *“Were you aware chief Alexander owed your brother money?”* Conrad asked Murdaugh. *“I was not,”* he responded. In addition to our prior reporting about a “loan” Alexander received from Alex Murdaugh, prosecution witness Nathan Tuten testified earlier in the trial about cashing checks at Palmetto State Bank (PSB) and delivering envelopes full of cash to Murdaugh at his law firm office. Among the individuals Tuten says he saw in Murdaugh’s office while he was delivering these envelopes were Alexander and attorneys Cory Fleming and Chris Wilson. He says Murdaugh stopped asking him to cash checks a few weeks before the homicides.|
|With the defense resting its case, the state will have an opportunity to present rebuttal witnesses beginning on Tuesday morning. Waters indicated at least four such witnesses were likely to be called, but that a fifth was *“possible.”* After the state concludes its rebuttal testimony, jurors will take their field trip and then hear closing arguments. Once those have concluded, Newman will charge the jury with its obligations under the law and deliberations will at long last begin …|

|WALTERBORO — As John Marvin Murdaugh cleaned his nephew’s blood and brains off a feed room floor on June 8, 2021, he made a silent vow. *“In my mind, I told Paul I loved him,”* he tearfully testified to a Colleton County jury on Feb. 27. *“I promised him that I’d find out who did this to him.”* *“Have you found out?”* asked Jim Griffin, a defense attorney representing John Marvin’s brother, Alex Murdaugh. *“I have not,”* John Marvin replied. John Marvin delivered his testimony just before Alex Murdaugh’s defense team rested its case in a Lowcountry double-murder trial that has captured international attention. His account offered more evidence that Murdaugh’s relatives support and believe him as he pleads his innocence in the brutal June 2021 slayings of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul. His testimony came just days after Murdaugh, 54, admitted to lying to investigators and loved ones about his whereabouts the night of the killings.|
|Prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General’s Office say Murdaugh, a once-respected Hampton lawyer, killed his wife and son to turn himself into a victim and delay a series of inquiries that could have soon exposed his decade-long habit of stealing from his clients and law partners. But Murdaugh’s immediate family has shown no signs they buy that theory. His brothers, John Marvin and Randy Murdaugh IV; sister-in-law Liz Murdaugh; sister Lynn Murdaugh Goette and remaining son Buster Murdaugh have sat a few rows behind him nearly every day of the trial. Buster, 26, testified Feb. 21 in his father’s defense, providing context and explanations for behavior by Murdaugh that state prosecutors had held up as suspicious.
In addition to Buster, John Marvin and a pair of family friends, Murdaugh’s defense team has marched a procession of expert witnesses to the stand to poke holes in the state’s forensics evidence and discredit the investigation that led to Alex Murdaugh’s July 2022 indictment.|
|On Feb. 27, a pathologist and crime scene analyst, for example, opined that the state’s pathologist had misjudged the trajectory of the shotgun blast that killed Paul. They confidently testified Paul was shot in the back of the head, execution-style, as he stumbled forward after the first shot grazed his chest. The state’s experts had insisted Paul was shot at a dramatic upward angle as he exited a feed room by a set of dog kennels on the family’s spacious Colleton County hunting estate. They said shotgun pellets grazed Paul’s left shoulder before entering under his jaw and ejecting his brain through the back of his skull. The defense’s experts also have helped advance a theory that 52-year-old Maggie and Paul, 22, were killed by two shooters.|
|Last week, a crime scene reconstruction expert testified his bullet trajectory analysis suggests Maggie’s shooter was a foot shorter than Murdaugh, who is 6 feet, 4 inches tall. On Feb. 27, crime scene analyst Tim Palmbach, the former director of the state of Connecticut’s forensics lab, said the totality of the evidence tells him the crime was likely committed by more than one person. Palmbach noted two long guns were used in the slayings: a 12-gauge shotgun, used to kill Paul, and a .300 Blackout semiautomatic rifle, which was turned on Maggie. Palmbach testified the evidence indicates Paul was shot first. His killer likely would have been briefly stunned by the blast’s force and the shower of blood, brain and skull matter that blew back, Palmbach said. he shooter could not have quickly recovered from that impact, dropped the shotgun, picked up a rifle and *“engaged in a meaningful assault”* of Maggie, who seemed to be running toward the gunfire, Palmbach testified.|
|Prosecutors didn’t grill Palmbach about his two-shooter theory. But they have consistently brushed aside defense experts’ notions that the angle of the shots was different than what the state’s pathologist found. And they’ve mocked the idea that other shooters could have driven onto the property just minutes after Murdaugh left the kennels, found family weapons, taken Paul by surprise and slipped away undetected. While the defense’s forensic experts have worked to tear open logical holes in the state’s case, Murdaugh’s legal team has called his relatives and family friends to the witness stand to humanize the defendant. Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, Jim Griffin and Dick Harpootlian, have worked to show he was a loving husband and adoring father who couldn’t possibly have executed his wife and son. John Marvin played his part Feb. 27, appearing folksy and emotional on the witness stand. The heavy-equipment dealer sparked laughter in the courtroom as he said he was proud to be the only member of his family not to attend law school. But he choked up as he spoke of Paul, Alex’s younger son, and of his brother’s relationship with Maggie and their boys.
He recalled how Alex Murdaugh would take Buster and Paul with him any time he went hunting. *“Anything that the boys were doing, Alex wanted to do,”* John Marvin said. *“The boys always came first to him.”* Alex and Maggie Murdaugh had *“hiccups”* just like any married couple, but they loved each other, John Marvin said. He recalled a double date he and his wife had taken with them to a Darius Rucker concert. Alex and Maggie sat a row ahead of them, holding hands and swaying to the music together. *“My wife tapped me and said, ‘Why aren’t you holding my hand?’”* John Marvin said. John Marvin testified his brother was *“absolutely hysterical”* over the phone on the night of June 7, 2021, when he called to relay that Maggie and Paul had been *“hurt really badly.”* John Marvin said he could see first responders’ flashing lights when he arrived at the family’s 1,700-acre hunting property, which they called “Moselle.” He found Alex Murdaugh near the dog kennels. Maggie and Paul’s bodies lay facedown nearby. *“He was just broken, distraught. Everybody was,”* John Marvin testified. *“All we did was hug and cried. I don’t even know that we talked.”* John Marvin testified he got little sleep that night before returning to Moselle the next day. He went down to the crime scene after state investigators had finished their work there, hoping for some semblance of closure. He and Paul had grown especially close, John Marvin told jurors through tears. Paul had been working for his uncle’s Beaufort-based heavy equipment business that summer. They bonded over a shared love of hunting and the outdoors. They were both outliers in a family of high-powered lawyers. John Marvin could still see the spot on the ground where Maggie’s body had been. And he found blood, brain matter and chunks of skull in the feed room where his nephew had been shot. He testified no mother, father, aunt or uncle should ever have to see that. *“I felt like I owed him,”* John Marvin said, *“and I just started cleaning.”* |

|WALTERBORO — On the final day of testimony in Alex Murdaugh’s double-murder trial, state prosecutors and a crime scene expert worked to debunk theories Murdaugh’s defense lawyers have floated in recent weeks to blame unknown assailants for the June 2021 slayings of his wife and son. Under questioning from S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson himself, the state’s crime scene analyst described as *“preposterous”* prior testimony by the defense’s forensic experts that suggested Murdaugh’s son Paul was killed with an execution-style shotgun blast to the back of his head. Kenneth Kinsey, an Orangeburg County sheriff’s deputy, also objected to a bullet trajectory analysis concluding the shooter who killed Murdaugh’s wife, Maggie, stood no taller than 5 feet 4 inches, about a foot shorter than the defendant.
And when Kinsey was asked if the available evidence could prove the defense’s theory that Maggie and Paul were slain by two shooters, rather than one, he replied emphatically, *“Absolutely not.”* Kinsey was the last of six witnesses called by the S.C. Attorney General’s Office to testify before the trial moves on to closing arguments and jury deliberations.|
|In all, the Colleton County jury considering Murdaugh’s fate has heard from 76 witnesses — several of them multiple times. More than 60 were called to the stand by prosecutors, who have spent the past five weeks trying to prove Murdaugh, a once-respected and since-disbarred Hampton lawyer, killed his wife and son in a cold-blooded and unsuccessful ploy to cover up his financial crimes. The June 7, 2021, slayings of two members of the prominent and influential Lowcountry family generated international intrigue. The story only gained steam over the following months as Murdaugh was ousted from the law firm his great-grandfather founded in 1910, admitted a two-decade opioid addiction, tried and failed to arrange his own death and was criminally charged with stealing nearly $9 million from people who trusted him. More than 20 months after Maggie and Paul were killed, the jury will decide in the coming days if Murdaugh was responsible.|
|But first, the jury on March 1 will travel to the crime scene, a set of dog kennels on the Murdaughs’ nearly 1,800-acre hunting property in Islandton, 30 minutes from the courthouse where they have gathered for the last six weeks. Judge Clifton Newman ordered the trip at the defense’s request and over the objection of prosecutors who said it would be potentially misleading because the scene has changed since 2021. After that, prosecutors and Murdaugh’s defense team will square off in closing arguments before the jury begins deliberating.|
|The last testimony jurors heard came from witnesses called by the state to rebut points raised in the past week by Murdaugh’s defense team. Murdaugh’s attorneys at various points in the trial have offered the possibility that Maggie and Paul were killed by two shooters. On Feb. 27, one of the defense’s crime scene experts testified he thought this scenario was likely, especially given both victims were killed with different long guns — a shotgun and an military-style rifle. The defense’s experts also have focused on the trajectories of the shots that killed Maggie and Paul, alleging the 6-foot-4 Murdaugh was too tall to have inflicted the wounds found on both victims.|
|Kinsey, a 30-year veteran of law enforcement who presented as both personable and witty, almost laughed off those theories. *“I think his intentions were well,”* Kinsey said of one defense expert, *“but I think his methods were flawed.”* Kinsey said the defense’s crime scene analysts were far too confident in their conclusions. He testified they also relied on assumptions that can’t be vetted, including the position and movement of the shooter as well as the way in which the still-missing rifle that killed Maggie ejects spent shell casings. Maggie’s killer could have been 7 feet 4 inches tall, for instance, depending on how they oriented their body, Kinsey said. The shooter could have crouched or pulled the trigger from their knees, Kinsey supposed.|
| *“The shooter is running around, and so is the victim,”* Wilson asserted, highlighting the difficulty of reconstructing a crime scene with certainty. *“It’s chaotic. It’s crazy. … There’s no way to know how the gun is being held, shouldered, angled.”* Kinsey agreed.|
|The state called several other witnesses to the stand Feb. 28, including a pair of former law partners who helped prosecutors paint Murdaugh as a master manipulator who lied easily and often to get what he wanted. Their testimony came after Murdaugh himself took the witness stand for two days last week, tearfully and forcefully insisting he did not kill his wife and son and could never have hurt them.|
|Parker Law Group attorney Ronnie Crosby described his former law partner on Feb. 28 as a *“theatrical-type presence in the courtroom.”* *“He could get very emotional doing closing arguments in front of a jury,”* Crosby said. In a tense exchange, Murdaugh defense attorney Dick Harpootlian tried to establish that Crosby testified out of anger for Murdaugh, whose thefts from legal clients left the law firm borrowing millions of dollars to pay them back. Crosby insisted he wasn’t still angry with Murdaugh. He used to be, particularly in fall 2021, but realized he needed to *“move on with life.”* He said he took issue with Harpootlian implying he’d lie on the witness stand out of spite. *“Even though it has cost your firm, and it’s cost millions of dollars to you, you’ve forgiven him?”* Harpootlian asked. *“I didn’t say I forgave him,”* Crosby retorted. *“I said I had no feelings. I’ve had to work on that.”* Harpootlian glanced over at the jury. He said it would be up to them to decide.|

| WALTERBORO — Disgraced former attorney Alex Murdaugh is a gifted liar who spent a decade concealing his true identity as a white-collar thief and opioid addict, prosecutor Creighton Waters told a Colleton County jury. In his closing argument on March 1, Waters reminded jurors that Murdaugh had deceived his family, his closest friends, his law partners and his legal clients — from whom he stole millions of dollars. Waters alleged the ex-Hampton lawyer’s web of lies led directly to the June 2021 slayings of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul — a pair of grisly killings that prosecutors say served as Murdaugh’s last-ditch effort to turn himself into a victim and buy time to cover up his soon-to-be-exposed thefts.|
|*“He’s fooled them all, and he fooled Maggie and Paul,”* Waters told the jury. *“And they paid for it with their lives. Don’t let him fool you, too.”* Waters ended his three-hour closing argument moments later by asking the jury to return a guilty verdict for Murdaugh in the murders of his wife and son. The state’s lead prosecutor asked jurors to vindicate Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, who *“need a voice because they can no longer speak.”* |
|Waters delivered his closing argument mid-way through the sixth week of a Walterboro double-murder trial that has attracted international attention. His presentation began shortly after jurors returned from a field trip to the crime scene — a set of dog kennels and sheds on the nearly 1,800-acre Colleton County hunting estate the prominent Murdaugh family called home. Throughout Waters’ closing argument, Murdaugh seemed to take on the affectation of an opposing attorney, scribbling notes in some moments and watching the prosecutor intently in others. |
|Murdaugh rarely evinced emotion, even as Waters repeatedly labeled him a liar and a killer. Murdaugh’s surviving son, Buster, brother John Marvin and sister Lynn also remained largely stoic as they watched from their seats in the courtroom. Murdaugh attorney Jim Griffin is expected to deliver the defense’s argument to the jury first thing March 2. Prosecutors will then have an opportunity to respond. Following that, the jury will be tasked with determining Murdaugh’s culpability for the grisly slayings.|
|Griffin said he expects his closing argument to last two hours. He will have plenty of ground to cover after Waters’ extensive presentation March 1.|
|Waters meticulously walked jurors through the greatest hits of the state’s case — from the financial crimes prosecutors believe motivated the killings to the minute-by-minute timeline investigators assembled from cellphone data. And he asked jurors to use their common sense to put the pieces together. That includes a timeline of digital evidence and a video on Paul’s cellphone that places Murdaugh at the scene of the crime with the victims just minutes before they abruptly stopped responding to text messages and phone calls. It also includes videos of three interviews in which Murdaugh repeatedly lied to investigators about being there.|
| *“Why would he lie about that, ladies and gentlemen?”* Waters asked. *“Why would he even think to lie about that if he was an innocent man?”* Waters also highlighted testimony that Maggie was killed with a family rifle that Murdaugh can’t account for. He noted investigators couldn’t rule out the possibility that Paul was shot with a family shotgun. Bullet casings found near Maggie’s body matched older casings found elsewhere on the Murdaugh’s hunting property and likely came from Paul’s missing .300 Blackout semiautomatic rifle, Waters said.|
| *“The defendant had the means to commit these crimes,”* Waters said. Waters noted neither Maggie nor Paul had defensive wounds, indicating they didn’t perceive their shooter as a threat. *“Why? Because it’s him,”* Waters said of Murdaugh. Waters accused Murdaugh of drawing on his experience as a lawyer and part-time prosecutor in the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office to mislead the state’s murder investigation and construct an alibi as he went. He contended that Murdaugh used two long guns to seed a theory that two people were involved, then disposed of them somewhere they haven’t been found, ditched Maggie’s phone down the road and got rid of the clothes he was wearing that evening. Waters also accused Murdaugh of making a flurry of phone calls and briefly visiting his ailing mother to create a cover story.|
| *“He’s smart. He’s a good lawyer. His family has a history of prosecution. He understands these issues,”* Waters said. *“He knows what to do to prevent evidence from being gathered.”*
Waters urged jurors not to believe what they heard when Murdaugh testified in his own defense last week. Murdaugh admitted to lying to investigators out of paranoia about becoming a suspect, but he forcefully denied hurting his wife and son.|
|For the first time since the killings, Murdaugh acknowledged that day from the witness stand that he went down to see Maggie and Paul at the dog kennels. But he insisted he returned back to the Moselle residence a few minutes later. *“I got out of there,”* Murdaugh said on the witness stand. Waters seized on that language during his closing argument, asking jurors if that sounds like a guiltless father.|
| *“He didn’t say: ‘If only I had been there. … If only I could have stopped it. If only I could have been there a little longer,’”* Waters said. *“He says, ‘I got out of there.’”* |
|Waters prepared jurors to hear in Griffin’s rebuttal that the state’s theory of the case is too bizarre to believe. Waters said if the state’s theory is hard to relate to, it’s because the Murdaugh saga is unlike any other — the violent unraveling of a man living a double life as a prosperous lawyer and a desperate con man.|
| *“He is a different man than the kind of stories you’ve seen before,”* Waters said. *“This is a different set of circumstances than you’ve seen before.”* Before wrapping up his argument, Waters showed the jury one last exhibit: a crime scene photo of the carnage the killer inflicted.  *“This is what he did,”* Waters said. *“This is what he did right here.”* |
|Earlier in the day, the jury spent more than an hour touring Moselle, the Murdaughs’ spacious hunting property on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties. The rural property, located in Islandton, has been essentially off-limits to the public since the June 2021 slayings. It also is under contract to be sold, with the proceeds to be split among Murdaugh’s relatives and his alleged financial victims, according to a legal settlement reached weeks ago. Jurors stayed at Moselle for about an hour and 15 minutes. They could be seen walking through the dog kennels and a shed, which was the location where Maggie and Paul were killed. One juror stood in the feed room doorway for a closer look at the spot where Paul was standing when a gunman turned a 12-gauge shotgun on him. The jury also viewed the outside of the property’s main house, and they pulled onto the sparse country road it sits on to walk to the family’s shooting range across the street.|
|Jurors and lawyers were escorted around the property by some of the key law enforcement witnesses who have testified before them. That included Daniel Greene, a sergeant with the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office. He was the first to arrive at the crime scene on the night of the slayings. Jurors were not allowed to speak with each other or ask questions of anyone other than Judge Clifton Newman. It also included Detective Laura Rutland, who interviewed Murdaugh on the night of the killings, and Capt. Jason Chapman, who supervised the crime scene until state investigators arrived. Jurors saw a sprawling property that has changed considerably since that time.|
|For most of the past year, no one regularly cared for the property as Murdaugh languished without bond in jail. Jurors saw tall grass and overgrown shrubs as they toured the property. The black mailbox at the driveway by the dog kennels was covered in pollen and spiderwebs. A “no trespassing” sign was tied to a post at the top of the mailbox. Lights atop the property’s ornamental brick entrance sat askew.
 rosecutors had also been careful to mention that a set of young pine trees planted between the house and kennels has had 20 months to grow since the slayings. They worried the trip might lead jurors to wrongfully conclude it would be difficult to see the kennels from the main residence nearly 400 yards away, and vice versa. But Murdaugh’s defense attorneys pushed for the field trip. They said it would help jurors get a lay of the land and see for themselves a place they have heard described at length for nearly six weeks.|

|Prosecutor Creighton Waters lowers the boom on Alex Murdaugh …|
|Disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh had the motive, means and opportunity to murder his wife and younger son on the family’s hunting property near Islandton, S.C. twenty-one months ago, according to lead prosecutor Creighton Waters. Not only that, his lies and guilty actions in the aftermath of the murders – combined with the sheer implausibility of any other rational scenarios for the carnage – demand guilty verdicts on all counts, Waters told jurors.|
| *“We couldn’t bring you any eyewitnesses – because they were murdered,”* Waters said.|
|Murdaugh is accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and for the last six weeks has been standing trial in Walterboro – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his famous family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century. The scion of an influential Lowcountry legal dynasty, Murdaugh once led the Palmetto State’s powerful trial lawyers’ lobby. Today, he is at the epicenter of a maze of alleged criminality known as the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|Ironically? It was Murdaugh’s own testimony which could play a pivotal role in sealing his fate.|
|In a closing argument which channeled his decisive cross-examination of Murdaugh less than a week ago, Waters walked jurors through Murdaugh’s “big lie” -a.k.a. his presence at the scene of the killings less than five minutes before they took place. |
|Jurors – who got a first-hand look at the crime scene on Wednesday morning – were also walked through how Murdaugh lied to them repeatedly on the witness stand last week. According to Waters, the defendant concocted a new story *“on the fly”* as he testified about his alleged reasons for deceiving investigators during an interview in the early morning hours of June 8, 2021.|
|Murdaugh testified it was his distrust of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED), opioid pills in his pockets and questions about his familial relationships from SLED investigator David Owen which caused him to experience paranoia – which in turn prompted him to lie. In fact, under questioning from Waters he identified the precise moment in the interview when he purportedly decided to deceive investigators.|
|Unfortunately for Murdaugh, he appears to have forgotten that he told the same lie on both the 9-1-1 call to dispatchers – and to sergeant Daniel Greene of the Colleton County sheriff’s office.|
| *“He was lying to you when he made those up,”* Waters said. *“Just like he’s lied to everyone who is close to him.”* |
| *“He’s good,”* Waters said. *“He’s good.”* According to Waters, Murdaugh *“lies convincingly – and can do it at the drop of a hat.”* Through Murdaugh’s maze of misinformation, Waters identified three things he said on the stand that had a ring of truth to them – that the killer of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh *“thought about it for a very long time,”* *“had hate in his heart”* and *“hurt the ones he loved the most.”* |
| *“He says things in one context and means them in another,”* Waters said.|
|Waters also pointed out to jurors Murdaugh’s habit of nodding when he is lying. *“Is that the most classic tell ever?”* he asked. *“I’ll leave that to you to decide.”* |
|As Waters delivered his closing, Murdaugh scanned the jury seeking to make eye contact with its members. Finding few takers, he opted to stare straight ahead – occasionally leaning over to one of his attorneys to confer. Waters’ closing argument had a bit of everything: A broad overview of Murdaugh’s financial crimes (and their imminent exposure), a detailed recapitulation of SLED’s timeline for the murders and – as mentioned – an exhaustive inventory of the many occasions when Murdaugh’s version of events ran counter to reality. Invariably, Waters said, such divergence took place when the defendant was *“confronted with facts he could no longer deny.”*|
|‘One thing I will agree with him is when he said, ‘oh what a tangled web we weave,'” Waters said, recalling Murdaugh’s invocation of the famous quote from Sir Walter Scott last Thursday. *“How appropriate is that.”*  |
|Every bit as effective as his flaying of Murdaugh was Waters’ mockery of assertions made by defense experts. Chief among them? The notion that the individual(s) who murdered Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were both diminutive in stature – and part of a completely static crime scene.|
| *“These vigilantes that are 5-foot-2 knew Paul and Maggie would be at Moselle, knew that they would be alone, knew the property well enough to get to the kennels – and assumed they would find ammunition and guns there,”* Waters said.|
| *“These vigilantes were just lucky enough to find these family weapons there,”* he said, noting they arrived at the kennels at the precise moment Murdaugh claims to have departed – without alerting any of the dogs roaming the property.|
|Waters concluded his closing with a passionate plea on behalf of the two victims – urging jurors to use their *“common sense and human nature”* as they prepare to begin their deliberations.|
| *“Maggie and Paul deserve a voice,”* he said. *“They need a voice because they can no longer speak. The system depends on those who take that oath as jurors – who make that tough decision to vindicate these victims. To vindicate Maggie and Paul – who were cut down in the prime of their lives.”* |
|As he spoke, Waters pulled up one of the graphic sealed exhibits depicting the sheer savagery of the slayings. |
| *“This is what he did,”* Waters said, pointing to Murdaugh. *“He fooled Maggie and Paul – and they paid for it with their lives,”* Waters concluded. *“Don’t let him fool you.”* |
|Murdaugh attorney Jim Griffin is scheduled to deliver the closing argument for the defense tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. EST. After he has finished, assistant attorney general John Meadors is expected to provide a rebuttal from the state. Once Meadors has concluded his remarks, judge Clifton Newman will instruct the jury as to its duties under the law. At that point, Murdaugh’s fate will rest in the hands of the twelve Colleton County chosen back on January 25, 2023.|
| **[‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial: Attorney General Stands And Delivers](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/03/01/murdaugh-murders-trial-attorney-general-stands-and-delivers/)** |
|Alan Wilson shines in ‘Trial of the Century.’|
|Heading into South Carolina’s ‘Trial of the Century,’ everyone knew the Palmetto State’s independently elected attorney general was a political animal. |
|But who knew he was such a beast in the courtroom? With everything on the line in this case – and with his daughter watching from the gallery – attorney general Alan Wilson stood and delivered a masterful performance at a pivotal moment in the double homicide trial of disbarred South Carolina lawyer Alex Murdaugh.|
| *“Just call him the closer,”* one attorney who watched Wilson’s work in court told me.|
|Murdaugh is accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and for the last six weeks has been standing trial in Walterboro – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his famous family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century.|
|Wilson wasn’t handling just any witness in this case, either. He was responsible for the direct examination of Kenneth Kinsey – the state’s top forensic expert and the final witness called in its rebuttal case against Murdaugh, who stands accused of brutally murdering his wife and son twenty-one months ago. It was up to Kinsey – with Wilson questioning him – to push back against several key points made by multiple defense experts called by Murdaugh’s attorneys.|
|In short, there was a ton of ground to cover … and considerable pressure to cover it quickly and concisely.|
|How did he do?|
|Inside and outside of the courtroom – and on multiple notoriously fickle social media feeds – reviews of Wilson’s performance were universally positive.|
| *“Who was that prosecutor?”* one out-of-state observer asked me outside the courthouse. *“They should have had him questioning more witnesses.”* |
|Another out-of-state source ignorant of Wilson’s status as attorney general concurred with that assessment.|
| *“Who was that ringer for the state?”* they said. *“And where has he been this whole trial?”* |
|Wilson’s performance even drew praise from several of his most vocal critics in the media – and reportedly from Murdaugh’s own attorneys, as well.|
|Most importantly, the jury seemed to like Wilson – and appeared to be having an easier time following his lines of questioning when compared to other prosecutors (with the notable exception of lead prosecutor Creighton Waters).|
|Wilson also incorporated better visual aids in his presentation – including a large poster showing an aerial view of the crime scene.|
|After walking Kinsey through several key rebuttals of the defense’s case (including its theory that there were two shooters at the scene who both stood between 5-foot-2 and 5-foot-4), Wilson participated in an effective reenactment of the shooting of Paul Murdaugh in a courtroom doorway.|
|With a twelve-gauge shotgun in his hands, Wilson positioned Kinsey in the doorway – just as Paul Murdaugh would have stood moments before receiving the fatal shotgun blast to his head. From there, he proceeded to twist and turn awkwardly around Kinsey so as to reposition himself directly behind the witness – demonstrating how difficult it would have been for someone to get into the right position (and hold the shotgun at the right angle) to inflict a contact wound to the back of Paul Murdaugh’s head.|
|The demonstration gave jurors a compelling visual look at the improbability of the defense’s theory of the shooting.|
|Wilson and Kinsey also discussed – in jarring detail – how contact wounds from shotguns obliterate a victim’s facial features.|
| *“You feel as though the forehead and the facial features are no longer there,”* Kinsey testified. *“They’ve been shredded. The person is just not there, it’s just a mess.”* |
|Pulling up one of the graphic autopsy photos of Paul Murdaugh, Wilson asked Kinsey whether what jurors were seeing was consistent with such a wound.|
| *“No – his face looks pretty normal,”* Kinsey said.|
|At the heart of Wilson’s examination of Kinsey was the dynamic nature of the crime scene – the motion of both victims and the shooter.|
| *“It’s chaotic, it’s crazy,”* Wilson said.|
| *“This was a very chaotic crime scene,”* Kinsey agreed. *“I think everything was moving. I’ve got a moving shooter. I’ve got a moving victim. This is a fluid and dynamic crime scene.”* |
| *“You’ve said there’s so much we don’t know,”* Wilson asked Kinsey. *“Could the shooter have been moving laterally? Could the shooter have been on his knees?”* |
|Kinsey acknowledged both of those were possibilities.|
| *“The defense is relying on math and absolutes,”* Kinsey said. *“In crime scene investigations, sometimes there are no absolutes.”* |
|According to my sources, Wilson agreed to conduct the direct examination of Kinsey so that lead prosecutor Creighton Waters could remain focused on closing arguments – which could begin on Wednesday. And while Wilson is the head of the agency, he reportedly deferred the decision on his examination of Kinsey to Waters – the man he tapped to lead the Murdaugh prosecution.|
|Waters clearly made the right call …|
|Wilson has been exceedingly active in this case from the beginning, sources close to his office have confirmed – assisting with pre-trial preparation and strategy as well as supporting his team of attorneys throughout the proceedings. He arrived in Walterboro, S.C. for the second week of the trial in late January, and has been seated at the prosecution table ever since.|

|Court is in session. Judge Clifton Newman will sentence Alex Murdaugh for the four charges he was convicted of March 2: two counts of murder and two counts of possessing a weapon during a violent crime. He faces a minimum of 30 years in state prison and a maximum life sentence on each of the two murder charges. |
|Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters said the state isn’t aware of anyone who wishes to make a victim impact statement at this time. Waters said the evidence against Murdaugh is overwhelming and shows this man is a *“cunning manipulator”* who placed himself above others, including his own family members. Waters offered his condolences to Murdaugh’s family members, turning at one point to face a row in the courtroom where Murdaugh’s brother, sister and remaining son Buster sat. His family has suffered, and they’ve had to suffer in the public eye, Waters said. The prosecutor said the *“only just sentence”* to honor the victims, Maggie and Paul, is two consecutive life sentences.|
| *“A man like that should never be allowed to be among free, law-abiding citizens again,”* Waters concluded.|
| Chief of the State Law Enforcement Division Mark Keel is present. His agency led the double-homicide investigation. *“We’re here to see justice is served, and we believe it has been,”* Keel said, adding he was proud of the work his agents have done.|
|Murdaugh defense attorney Dick Harpootlian said his team had no comments, but that his client wished to address the court. Murdaugh, dressed in a tan prison jumpsuit, stood emotionless as he maintained his innocence in front of the packed room.|
| *“I’m innocent,”* he said. *“I would never hurt my wife Maggie and I would never hurt my son PawPaw.”* |
|The judge accused Murdaugh of engaging in *“such duplicitous conduct”* in this courtroom and on the witness stand. Newman said he doesn’t expect Murdaugh to confess to killing Maggie and Paul. The judge has yet to find a defendant who could *“go back to that moment in time”* when they *“decided to pull the trigger”* and murder someone, he said. |
|The judge mentioned Murdaugh’s case qualifies under South Carolina’s death penalty statute, but prosecutors didn’t decided to pursue it. Newman doesn’t question their decision, he said. But he pointed out Murdaugh’s family members successfully prosecuted many defendants who received a death sentence, *“probably for lesser conduct”* than what he was convicted of, Newman said.
Newman called the case “one of the most troubling” not only for him as a judge, for the state and for Murdaugh’s defense team, but for “all of the citizens in this community, all the citizens in this state.”|
|Newman described Murdaugh as a former lawyer from a family who has *“controlled justice in this community for over a century.”* The judge mentioned he had to order a portrait of Murdaugh’s grandfather be removed from where it hung in the back of the courtroom in order to ensure a fair trial.|
| This case is particularly troubling because Murdaugh is a well-known member of the legal community who’s practiced law before Newman, the judge said. *“It was especially heartbreaking for me to see you go in the media from being a grieving father who lost a wife and a son to being the person indicted and convicted of killing them,”* Newman said.|
|Newman asked Murdaugh what he meant on the witness stand when he said, *“Oh, what tangled webs we weave.”* |
| *“I meant when I lied, I continued to lie,”* Murdaugh replied.|
| *“And the question is, when will it end?”* Newman asked, accusing him of continuing to lie when he testified last week. The judge told Murdaugh he’d have to reckon with seeing Paul and Maggie when he tries to sleep at night: *“I’m sure they come and visit you.”* |
| *“All day, and every night,”* Murdaugh replied.|
|Newman gave him another chance to confess.|
| *“I respect this court, but I’m innocent,”* the defendant said. *“I would never, under any circumstances, hurt my wife Maggie, and I would never, under any circumstances, hurt my son PawPaw.”* |
| *“And it might not have been you,”* Newman said. *“It might have been the monster you become when you take 15, 20, 30 … 60 opioid pills. Maybe you become another person.”* |
|Before announcing Murdaugh’s sentence, Newman said he wanted to talk about scheduling for the other 99 charges the defendant faces accusing him of myriad financial crimes. There are other victims whose cases deserve to be heard, the judge said. |
|Newman addressed prosecutors’ theory of Murdaugh’s motive in carrying out the slayings. He said Murdaugh had *“quite a bit”* going through his mind on June 7, 2021. |
| *“But amazingly, to have you come and testify that it was just another ordinary day — that ‘my wife and son and I were just out enjoying life,’”* Newman said. *“Not credible. Not believable. You can convince yourself about it, but obviously you have the inability to convince anyone else about that.”* Newman sentenced Murdaugh to life in prison for both the murders of Maggie and Paul. The sentences will run consecutively, he said.|
|After Murdaugh was led out of the courtroom, Newman addressed the courtroom for a final time. He said it wouldn’t surprise them if any of the 12 jurors decided to publicly speak, given the *“life-changing experience”* they went through.|
| **[LIVE FEED – ‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial: Alex Murdaugh Sentencing Hearing](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/03/03/live-feed-murdaugh-murders-trial-alex-murdaugh-sentencing-hearing/)** |
|Life sentences looming?|
| Convicted killer Alex Murdaugh will stand before South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman on Friday and receive his fate – which is widely expected to be a pair of consecutive life sentences (without the possibility of parole) on the murder charges and additional years on the two weapons charges.|
|Having been found guilty of the savage slayings of his wife and younger son on Thursday evening, the disbarred, disgraced Palmetto State attorney – decked out in prison garb and shackled at the hands and feet – will look markedly different than he has in court over the past six weeks.|
|During his trial, Murdaugh has appeared in neatly pressed shirts, slacks and sport coats.|
|Not anymore …|
|After six weeks of testimony, a Colleton County reportedly took less than an hour to find Murdaugh guilty of brutally murdering his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the family’s 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatchie River on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties.|
| *“I’m sorry,”* Murdaugh mouthed to his surviving son, Buster Murdaugh, as he was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom. *“I love you. I love you.”* |
|Murdaugh’s attorneys have thirty days to appeal his convictions, and his sister Lynn Goettee noted on social media that we should expect a “lengthy appeals process.”|
|While that process unfolds, Murdaugh will be transferred at some point over the next few days from the custody of the Colleton County sheriff’s office into the custody of the S.C. Department of Corrections (SCDC).|
|What will that process look like? In South Carolina, all new male inmates are taken to Kirkland reception and evaluation center – which is located approximately seven miles northwest of Columbia, S.C.|
|Kirkland is a maximum security prison which is part of the Broad River road correctional complex. The facility “receives, assesses, classifies and assigns all male offenders age 17 and above sentenced to 91 days or more.”|
|According to my sources, Murdaugh will be housed in a secure unit at Kirkland and evaluated to determine where his best placement within the SCDC system will be. That decision will be made based on a number of factors including a medical examination, mental health assessment and other tests.
The scion of an influential South Carolina legal dynasty, Murdaugh once led the Palmetto State’s powerful trial lawyers’ lobby. Today, he is at the center of a maze of alleged criminality known as the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|To be clear: Murdaugh’s conviction on murder charges does NOT mean this story is over. Far from it.|
|The 54-year-old is also staring down a multitude of alleged financial crimes (many of which he admitted to on the stand last week) as well as drug charges and allegations of obstruction of justice tied to a fatal 2019 boat crash involving his late son. Additionally, he is facing fraud charges tied to a bizarre, botched suicide attempt on Labor Day weekend in 2021.|
|All of these are state charges. Murdaugh has yet to be charged federally – although our sources say that is likely to change very soon. Murdaugh is also expected to be slapped with additional state charges, as well.|
|Oh, and to top it all off he was charged last week with a misdemeanor contraband offense by Colleton County deputies.|
|Court has resumed. Judge Newman has taken the stand. Creighton Waters has handed the sentencing sheets to Clerk of Court Rebecca Hill. The State has no victim impact statements at this time. Waters states Murdaugh is a *“cunning manipulator.”* He states Murdaugh violated the trust of his family, friends, law partners, and most of all, Maggie and Paul.|
|Waters tells Judge Newman that Paul and Maggie were both cut down in the prime of their lives. Both of them were unaware of who Murdaugh really was. Waters says, *“I’ve looked in his eyes and I could see the real Alex Murdaugh when he looked at me.”*  Waters says he would like Judge Newman to give Alex Murdaugh the maximum sentence. The victim advocate says that none of the victims are willing to speak and they want to be sensitive to them.|
|SLED Chief Mark Keel speaks and says he is proud of his staff and they are here to see justice served. Griffin and Harpootlian have no comment, but Murdaugh would like to address the court. Murdaugh says, *“I’m innocent and I would never hurt my wife, Maggie and I would never hurt Paul Paul.”* |
|Judge Newman says he has been assigned to preside over 99 other cases, but he will not make comment regarding those pending matters. He tells Murdaugh that as a member of the legal community, he has practiced law before him and they have seen each other on various occasions over the years. It was especially heartbreaking for Judge Newman to see Murdaugh go from being a grieving partner to the person who was indicted and convicted of killing him. He states Murdaugh has engaged in duplicitous conduct in the courtroom and on the witness stand.|
|Judge Newman says this case qualifies for the death penalty by definition of the crime. He doesn’t question the decision of the State not to pursue the death penalty, but as he sits in the courtroom and reflects on the fact that over the last century, his family, including him and is reminded that many of them have received the death penalty for lesser conduct. Judge Newman asks Murdaugh, *“When is it going to end?”* He continues, *“Perhaps you believe it does not matter. That there is nothing to mitigate the sentence of the crimes that were committed.”* Judge Newman reminds Murdaugh the notice of alibi was filed in November and in the last minute and days of the trial, he admitted to being there. Judge Newman says when I ask where it will end, *“Within your own soul you are going to have to deal with that.”* He hopes Murdaugh reflects on the last time he looked Paul and Maggie in the eyes.|
|Judge Newman tells Murdaugh he had such a lovely family, including him. Murdaugh now has an opportunity to make a final appeal as an ex-lawyer and it is surprising that he is waiving his right at this time. He is not compelled to do so. Murdaugh repeats that statement that he would never hurt Maggie or Paul. Judge Newman says, *“Maybe it wasn’t you. Maybe it was the monster inside you.”*|
|Judge Newman says without any delay, they will begin to schedule other matters relating to Murdaugh’s cases. **He says they may have worn their welcome out in Colleton County, but says there are other cases that deserve to be heard.** Judge Newman says he can imagine that day on June 7, 2021 when a lawyer has confessed that he stole $500,000 and he has a tiger like Mark Tinsley on his tail pursuing discovery. And has a father, for the most part, on his death bed. Judge Newman says, *“It was an ordinary day. Not credible. Not believable.”* |
|Judge Newman, *“Mr. Murdaugh, I sentence you for the term of the rest of your natural life for the murder of Paul, who you probably loved so much. I sentence you to prison for murdering him for the rest of your natural life.”* |
|Judge Newman says that an order has been issued maintaining the confidentiality of the jurors except for a video of the defendant leaving the courtroom. The jurors have the right to continue to maintain their confidentiality, but are not obligated to do so.|
| **[Alex Murdaugh Sentenced To Life Behind Bars](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/03/03/alex-murdaugh-sentenced-to-life-behind-bars/)** |
|South Carolina’s ‘Trial of the Century’ is over … but the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga is just heating up.|
|As expected, convicted killer Alex Murdaugh was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and younger son nearly two years ago on his family compound near Islandton, S.C.|
| *“You’ve engaged in such duplicitous conduct – including here in the courtroom and on the witness stand,”* S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman said in sentencing the 54-year-old disbarred attorney. *“It was especially heartbreaking for me to see you go from being a grieving father to being the person indicted and convicted (for these murders).”* |
|Murdaugh was found guilty on Thursday evening of the savage slayings of his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and younger son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the family’s 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatchie River on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties.|
|The jury began its deliberations at 3:50 p.m. EST on Thursday and the verdicts were read by Colleton County clerk of court Becky Hill just after 7:07 p.m. EST. Reports indicate jurors took less than an hour to come to their final verdict, though.|
|Of interest? The road to a guilty verdict was paved by a decision Thursday morning by judge Newman to remove a juror for improperly discussing the case. That particular juror was a hard “not guilty,” according to multiple sources familiar with the deliberations. Had she remained on the panel she would have likely prevented a unanimous guilty verdict.|
|Our sources also indicated a Wednesday morning field trip to the scene of the crime – which was requested by the defense – actually solidified the ‘guilty’ votes on the jury and may have swayed one or two jurors who were previously undecided. That decision clearly backfired.|
|In recommending the maximum sentence for Murdaugh, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters told Newman the convicted killer was *“a cunning manipulator who placed himself above all others – including his family.”* |
| *“I’ve looked in his eyes,”* he said. *“He liked to stare me down. And I could see the real Alex Murdaugh.”* |
| *“I’m innocent,”* Murdaugh told Newman when offered the opportunity to speak. *“I would never hurt my wife, Maggie. I would never hurt my son, Paul Paul.”* |
|At one point during the sentencing, Newman engaged Murdaugh directly. *“Remind me of what you said on the stand?”* he asked, referring to Murdaugh’s invocation of Sir Walter Scott‘s famous quote: ‘Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.” |
| *“What did you mean by that?”* Newman asked Murdaugh.|
| *“I meant that when I lied I continued to lie,”* Murdaugh responded.|
| *“The question is when will it end?”* Newman asked.|
|In an especially chilling moment, Newman suggested Murdaugh’s dreams would be haunted by his victims in the future *“when he tried to sleep.”* *“I am sure they will come and visit you,”* Newman said.|
| *“All day and every day,”* Murdaugh responded.|
| *“I’m sure they will continue to do so,”* Newman said.|
|Prior to the final adjournment of the trial, Murdaugh’s attorneys raised the issue of the purportedly accidental dissemination of autopsy photos – which were shown briefly during Court TV‘s feed of the proceedings.|
| *“The parties have requested an investigation into that,”* Newman said, adding that his *“hands were full”* with a backlog of work and that he would defer to law enforcement as to whether to initiate an inquiry.|
|*“To the extent law enforcement wishes to investigate that, they can,”* Newman said.|
|*“They will,”* Harpootlian fired back.|
|And with that final volley, the judge raised his gavel for the first (and only) time during the six week trial and declared *“our business in Colleton County is done”* – formally concluding the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century.’|
|After the trial concluded, there was a flurry of activity outside the courthouse as attorneys for Murdaugh – led by Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin – announced their intention to file a notice of appeal within ten days. Among the likely issues to be raised? A comment made by assistant attorney general John Meadors during his passionate rebuttal argument about how the state did not have to prove motive.|
| *“We think the appellate courts will take a strong look at that,”* Griffin said.|
| *“It was about character, it was not about motive,”* Harpootlian added, saying the case was essentially lost the moment Newman agreed to the *“admission of all the financial crimes.”* |
| *“The judge was misled,”* Harpootlian said.|
|Harpootlian also blasted agents of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) – saying the agency needed to *“do some serious self-examination on the forensic front.”* *“If they’d taken fingerprints, preserved footprints, gathered GPS data from Maggie’s phone … and not misrepresented to the grand jury that he had blood on his shirt,”* Harpootlian said, referring to SLED’s investigation as a *“comedy of errors.”* |
|Asked about Newman’s comments to Murdaugh earlier in the day, Harpootlian said the judge was *“entitled to his opinion.”* |
|To view the full press conference, [click here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyR8OgnREhE) |
|Attorney Eric Bland – who represented several of Murdaugh’s financial victims – called the defense’s press gaggle outside the courthouse as *“the most tone deaf press conference I’ve ever heard.”* |

|WALTERBORO — Disgraced former attorney Alex Murdaugh will spend the rest of his life behind bars after his conviction in the June 2021 murders of his wife and son, sealing his stunning downfall in a courtroom where his father, grandfather and great-grandfather once tried cases as this region’s top prosecutors. Judge Clifton Newman invoked the once-proud history of the Murdaugh name on March 3 as he sentenced the former Hampton lawyer and part-time prosecutor to consecutive life terms, noting that Murdaugh’s ancestors had walked into that same room to seek the death penalty against others for less. Then, with a rap of his gavel, Newman brought to a close the six-week double-murder trial that brought the eyes of the world to South Carolina’s Lowcountry.|
|Murdaugh, dressed in a khaki-colored prison jumpsuit and bright orange slides, stood emotionless in front of a packed courtroom that included his sister, youngest brother and surviving son Buster. Dismissed from service, 10 of the 12 jurors who voted to convict him joined the gallery to watch the conclusion as members of the public.|
|Murdaugh, 54, maintained his innocence in the grisly slayings of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul on the prominent family’s nearly 1,800-acre Colleton County hunting estate. *“I respect this court,”* Murdaugh said, with a tone of insistence despite a slight tremble in his voice. *“But I am innocent, and I would never under any circumstances hurt my wife, Maggie, and I would never under any circumstances hurt my son PawPaw.”* |
|In a press conference shortly after noon, Murdaugh’s defense attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin said they would appeal the guilty verdict all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. They criticized Newman’s decision to admit evidence of Murdaugh’s alleged financial crimes, which in prosecutors’ theory motivated the killings. Instead of establishing a logical motive for the slayings, his attorneys said, prosecutors used the evidence to bash Murdaugh for weeks as a monster who stole from his clients and others who trusted him. Prosecutors won this case the day Newman *“bought into”* their notion that the imminent exposure of Murdaugh’s financial crimes doubled as his motive to kill Maggie and Paul, Harpootlian said. |
|In a scathing assessment of Murdaugh and his precipitous fall from grace, Newman said that while the defendant may be able to convince himself of his innocence, hardly anyone else believes him.|
|Testifying in his own defense, Murdaugh admitted to leading a life filled with deceit: He lied to his law partners and family about his whereabouts the night of the killings, and to his clients, from whom he acknowledged stealing millions of dollars.|
|The judge accused Murdaugh of continuing to lie even when he took the witness stand in his own defense. *“And the question is, when will it end?”* Newman asked. Newman described the Murdaugh murders as one of the most troubling cases he’s ever handled — not only for him as a judge, for the state and for Murdaugh’s defense team, but for *“all of the citizens in this community, all the citizens in this state.”* Newman has known Murdaugh, a once-respected fixture of South Carolina’s legal community, for years. The defendant has argued cases before him.|
| *“It was especially heartbreaking for me to see you go in the media from being a grieving father who lost a wife and a son to being a person indicted and convicted of killing them,”* the judge said.|
|Before handing down his sentence, Newman emphasized Murdaugh’s legacy as a former lawyer and member of a family who has *“controlled justice in this community for over a century.”* His father, grandfather and great-grandfather each served as the 14th Judicial Circuit’s elected solicitor over a span of 86 years. Newman recalled having to remove a portrait of Murdaugh’s grandfather, Buster Murdaugh Jr., from where it hung in the back of the 201-year-old courtroom to ensure a fair trial, leaving a blank wall for its 29-day duration.|
|Newman noted that prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General’s Office could have sought the death penalty and decided against it. Newman said he doesn’t question their decision.|
|But he pointed out how three generations of Murdaugh men had successfully sought the death penalty for dozens of defendants — some of them in the same Colleton County courthouse and many *“for lesser conduct”* than the gruesome, close-range butchering of their family. In a particularly chilling moment, the judge told Murdaugh he’ll have to reckon with what he’s done when he tries to sleep at night. He must see Maggie and Paul as he closes his eyes, Newman said: *“I’m sure they come and visit you.”* |
|As Murdaugh once again denied his part in the killings, Newman supposed his drug addiction of some two decades could have transformed the defendant that night. *“It might not have been you,”* the judge said. *“It might have been the monster you become when you take 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 opioid pills. Maybe you become another person.”* Murdaugh faced a minimum of 30 years behind bars on each of the murder counts. |
|Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters requested the life sentence, which was handed down a day after a Colleton County jury took less than three hours to reach a guilty verdict. *“A man like that should never be allowed to be among free, law-abiding citizens again,”* Waters said. |
|State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel, whose investigators were blasted as incompetent and ineffective by Murdaugh’s defense attorneys throughout the trial, offered a brief statement just before Murdaugh was sentenced: *“We’re very proud of our agency.”* |
|Ten of the 12 jurors returned to court as members of the public to attend the hearing, escorted by court security at 9:30 a.m. sharp. They sat together in the wooden benches, some smiling and laughing as they chatted with one another.|
| Craig Moyer, a carpenter and member of the final panel, told ABC News late March 2 about how the jurors had arrived at their decision. When they began deliberating, nine jurors believed Murdaugh was guilty, two thought he was not guilty and one wasn’t sure, said Moyer, whose vote was guilty from the start. He said his mind was made up when he heard Murdaugh admit to being with Maggie and Paul at the family’s dog kennels after claiming for more than a year he’d been asleep on the couch. He said it took only about 45 minutes for everyone to reach the same conclusion. Moyer didn’t explain what jurors were doing for the remaining two hours. *“The evidence was clear,”* he said, referencing a video filmed on Paul’s cellphone at the kennels that captured Murdaugh’s voice shortly before the killings. It placed the defendant at the crime scene minutes before 52-year-old Maggie and 22-year-old Paul were shot — a fact Murdaugh initially lied about. And the juror wasn’t swayed by the emotion Murdaugh displayed when he took the stand. Moyer said he never saw tears spill from his eyes: *“All he did was blow snot.”*
Murdaughs’ attorneys said they don’t regret their work on the case, including allowing their client to take the witness stand in his own defense and deciding not to try to move the case out of Colleton County. Much of the jury pool there had ties to the trial’s witnesses and virtually everyone knew about the case.|
|One prospective juror said she was engaged to one of the first deputies on scene, for instance. One said his cousin was a deputy, and others said they went to church with first responders. Even the clerk of court’s daughter was called, part of a jury pool that comprised more than 2 percent of the county’s citizens. |
|The defense team conducted focus groups of potential jurors all over South Carolina. Everywhere they went, people had heard about the Murdaugh saga from news accounts, social media posts and true-crime documentaries, Harpootlian said. *“There was nowhere we could go,”* he said. None of Murdaugh’s family members spoke at his sentencing hearing, either for or against him. Griffin said it wouldn’t have made a difference. Mother Teresa herself could have appeared to speak on Murdaugh’s behalf and Newman still would have given him two life sentences, Griffin said.|
|A Colleton County jury of seven men and five women deliberated for just under three hours on March 2 before returning guilty verdicts on all four charges: two counts of murder in the fatal shootings of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh and two counts of possessing a weapon during a violent crime.|
|Following the half-hour hearing, a shackled Murdaugh was escorted from the courtroom, eyes cast down as he shuffled out for the final time.|
|He’ll be transported to the Kirkland Reception and Evaluation Center, the S.C. Department of Corrections’ processing center in Columbia. Murdaugh will undergo medical tests, as well as mental health and education assessments, spokeswoman Chrysti Shain said. Murdaugh will be assigned a specific custody level and prison based on the test results, she added. The process will take about 45 days.|
|The move is a stark change for Murdaugh, a man who earned millions each year as a lawyer and stole millions more to fund a lavish lifestyle that included a sprawling country estate, a beachside home and sea islands along South Carolina’s coast.|
|He has traded that opulence for a 10-by-8-foot prison cell of concrete and steel, outfitted with just a toilet, bed and sink.|

|ISLANDTON — Jurors rode with a caravan of sheriff’s deputies down a narrow country road past cow pastures and a handful of homes to consider the mystery of what happened here behind a stand of pine trees, a place remote in location but deep in the American fascination. They saw the narrow dog food storage room where Paul Murdaugh was blasted twice with a shotgun at close range. They saw the lean-to shed where his mother, Maggie, was gunned down as, prosecutors contend, she ran to her son.|
|And they saw the dog kennels where Paul took one of the last actions in his 22-year life: recording a video of a dog’s possibly injured tail. The footage would have been unexceptional if it hadn’t captured the voice of his father in the background. Alex Murdaugh told investigators, friends and his slain wife’s family that he hadn’t been with them. In his last moments, Paul, described by family as a “little detective,” caught Murdaugh in a lie.|
|The next day, the jurors decided they had heard enough. They quickly returned guilty verdicts March 2 against Murdaugh, the once-prosperous, now-notorious fourth-generation lawyer from one of South Carolina’s smallest counties. They look less time to make their decision than prosecutors spent laying out their case in closing arguments. But while 12 jurors decided they were convinced of Murdaugh’s responsibility for the killings, the six-week trial did more to sketch the outlines of what happened on June 7, 2021, than it did to answer how and why it did.|
|For weeks, the mystery of the Murdaugh murders drew hundreds of onlookers to Walterboro’s small, antebellum courthouse each day and millions of viewers to YouTube livestreams and the national news. With the world watching, jurors answered the question of who committed the killings, but the proceedings left much of the mystery unresolved.|
|Even Judge Clifton Newman was left to wonder what could have led Murdaugh to such brutality.|
|Prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General’s Office laid out reams of evidence describing what happened that night at the Murdaugh family’s remote, sprawling hunting estate along the banks of the Salkehatchie River. |
|They presented granular data from Maggie and Paul’s iPhones, showing down to the second when they read text messages, awakened the screen and even turned their phones to one side. |
|They showed jurors data from the black box of Murdaugh’s car, letting them see exactly when and how fast he drove off his property that night. |
|They brought a forensic analysis of the bullet casings found near Maggie’s body showing the rifle she was killed with made tiny marks matching those on casings elsewhere on the property.|
|They used Paul’s cellphone video of the dog to show that Murdaugh, 54, was with his wife and son as late as 8:45 p.m. And they used their phones’ data to show that Maggie and Paul abruptly stopped responding to phone calls and text messages at 8:49 p.m. |
|But even a close examination of Maggie and Paul’s digital lives could offer only a broad-stroked sketch of what transpired in those four minutes, presumably their last. While insisting he left the kennels before they died, Murdaugh testified that the family’s dogs roamed around seemingly unalarmed, as though they didn’t detect the presence of an intruder. |
|Paul opened a text message from a friend asking for a happy movie to watch because she didn’t want to see something sad; then his phone locked for the last time.|
|Maggie opened a group message about Murdaugh’s dying father, who had been readmitted to the hospital earlier in the day. Her phone locked for the last time 30 seconds after Paul’s had.|
|Investigators never located the weapons used in the killings. They also could not find bloody clothes, though prosecutors cast suspicion on Murdaugh by providing evidence that he changed at some point that evening. They argued that the clothes officers saw him wearing were too clean for a man who claimed he had checked on his slain family while he waited for help to arrive.|
| *“Maybe he just got angry. … Maybe he just lost it. Maybe it looked like a suicide and then Maggie came and he had to shoot her,”* prosecutor John Meadors said in a closing argument. *“I don’t know. Only one person knows.”* |
|The prosecution also took pains to detail the context of Murdaugh’s life in 2021, arguing that on the night of the killings, he stood at the precipice of a ruinous fall from grace.|
|His law firm’s finance chief confronted him that afternoon about legal fees she couldn’t account for. He spent part of his workday preparing for a court hearing at which he might have been ordered to turn over information about his finances. They were swamped by debt and held up by a long, hidden history of stealing.|
|A month earlier, Paul had demanded to talk about a bag of pills found in his father’s computer bag, according to cellphone records; the day before the killing, Murdaugh skipped at least part of a postseason Gamecock baseball game because he was ill, apparently in the throes of withdrawal from opioid pills. But Murdaugh had attempted detoxing before, and the family was well aware of his addiction, his surviving son Buster said.|
|Trial observers have inferred countless possible motives from the evidence. Prosecutors’ official theory is that Murdaugh used the killings to shut down questions about his finances and keep his alleged thefts hidden. Yet the true motivation for the killings is a mystery all the same.|
|Family friends testified they viewed Murdaugh as a loving husband and doting father. There was scant evidence shown at trial to suggest his marriage or his relationship with his son had suddenly frayed.|
|There was no conclusive answer for why, one Monday evening, he would blast his son with a shotgun and turn a military-style rifle on his 52-year-old wife.|
|Those answers aren’t likely to come from Murdaugh, who twice professed his innocence the morning after the jury returned its verdict.|
|Standing before Newman awaiting his prison sentence, Murdaugh insisted — just as he had on the witness stand — that he would never hurt his wife and son. Even if he had recanted, his story would be clouded by his long history of admitted lies.|
|From the witness stand, Murdaugh acknowledged lying over and over to his clients, from whom he admitted stealing money. And he testified that he’d lied to investigators and family about where he had been the night of the murders, saying he’d been napping when he had really been at the kennels. One juror told ABC News that Murdaugh’s admission sealed his guilty vote.|
|As he testified, Murdaugh alluded to the words of the Scottish novelist Sir Walter Scott, saying, *“Oh what a tangled web we weave.”* Preparing to sentence him, Newman asked him to explain why he invoked that quote.|
| *“I meant when I lied, I continued to lie,”* said Murdaugh, who insisted in his testimony that he is now telling the truth about June 7, 2021.|
| *“And the question is, when will it end? When will it end?”* Newman responded. *“It’s ended already for the jury, because they’ve concluded you continued to lie and lied throughout your testimony.”*|
|Newman said it had ended for most everyone in the public, too, as the “throngs” around the Colleton County Courthouse seemed to have decided he was not telling the truth.|
|All that remained, the judge said, was for Murdaugh to address his lies *“within your own soul.”* He urged Murdaugh to think of Maggie and Paul and *“reflect on the last time you looked them in the eyes, as you looked the jury in the eyes.”* |
|Considering Murdaugh’s sentence March 3, Newman seemed to wrestle with the same question of why Maggie and Paul died, finding the same uncertain answers.|
|The judge said that in his 22 years on the bench, he had heard convicted killers confess, but he’d never heard one *“go there”* — to return to the moment they pulled the trigger and explain why.|
|*“It might not have been you. It might have been the monster you become when you take 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 opioid pills. Maybe you become another person. I’ve seen that before,”* Newman said.|
|Looking straight at Murdaugh, the judge engaged in a 17-minute soliloquy about the case, which he said he’d found particularly troubling. He reflected on the Murdaugh family’s long hold on prosecutorial power in the southern end of South Carolina, his betrayal of his oath as an attorney, and the brutality of the murders for which he was convicted.|
|Newman tried to imagine the pressures Murdaugh was under: the law firm questioning him, another lawyer pressing him for financial records, his father all but on his death bed.|
|Yet, Newman added, Murdaugh testified that it had been a typical day, *“just enjoying life”* with his wife and son. It didn’t make sense, the judge said.|
|*“You can convince yourself about it, but obviously you have the inability to convince anyone else about that,”* Newman said.
Then he handed down his decision of consecutive life sentences and ordered Murdaugh into state custody. His legs shackled, a deputy holding his arm, he shuffled through the door he had entered each of the 29 days of the trial that sealed his fall from grace.|
|Murdaugh looked back into the courtroom for a moment, and the door closed.|

| “This has been perhaps one of the most troubling cases not just for me as a judge, for the state, for the defense team, but for all of the citizens in this community, all the citizens in this state, as we have seen based on the media coverage throughout the nation,” Newman said. “You have a wife who has been killed, murdered. A son savagely murdered. A lawyer, a person from the respected family who has controlled justice in this community for over a century, a person whose grandfather’s portrait hang at the back of the courthouse that I had to have ordered removed in order to ensure that a fair trial was had by both the state and the defense.|
|“It is also particularly troubling, Mr. Murdaugh, because as a member of the legal community, and a well known member of the legal community, you have practiced law before me, and we have seen each other at various occasions throughout the years, and it was especially heartbreaking for me to see you go in the media from being a grieving father who lost a wife and a son to being the person indicted and convicted of killing them, and you have engaged in such duplicitous conduct here in the courtroom, here on the witness stand, and as established by the testimony throughout the time leading from the time of the indictment and prior to the indictment throughout the trial to this moment in time, certainly you have no obligation to say anything other than saying not guilty.|
|“Obviously, as appeals are probably expected or absolutely expected, I would not expect a confession of any kind. In fact, as I have presided over murder cases over the past 22 years, I have yet to find a defendant who could go there, who could go back to that moment in time when they decided to pull the trigger or to otherwise murder someone. I have not been able to get anyone, any defendant, even those who have confessed to being guilty to go back and explain to me what happened at that moment in time when they opted to pull the trigger, when they opted to commit the most heinous crime known to man.”|
|“This case qualifies under our death penalty statue based on the statutory aggravating circumstances of two or more people being murdered by the defendant by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. I don’t question at all the decision of the state not to pursue the death penalty. But as I sit here in this courtroom and look around at the many portraits of judges and other court officials and reflect on the fact that over the past century, your family, including you, have been prosecuting people here in this courtroom and many have received the death penalty, probably for lesser conduct.|
|“Remind me of the expression you gave on the witness stand. Oh, what tangled web we weave. What did you mean by that?”|
|“I meant when I lied, I continued to lie,” Murdaugh replied.|
|“And the question is when will it end? When will it end? And it has ended already for the jury, because they’ve concluded that you continue to lie and lied throughout your testimony. And perhaps with all the throng of people here, they for the most part all believe or 80, 90& or 99% believe that you continue to lie now when your statement of denial to the court.”|
|“We conducted a pretrial hearing in which you claim to have been someplace else at the time the crime was committed, and then after all of the witnesses placed you at the scene of the crime, at the last minutes or days you switched courses and admitted to being there. And then that necessitated more lies and continued to lie, and I say when will it end, it has already ended for many who have heard you and concluded that it will never end.|
|“But within your own soul, you have to deal with that. And I know you have to see Paul and Maggie during the nighttime when you’re attempting to go to sleep. I’m sure they come and visit you, I’m sure.”|
|Murdaugh replied: “All day and every night.”|
|“I’m sure,” Newman said. “And they will continue to do so. And reflect on the last time they looked you in the eyes, as you looked the jury in the eyes.”|
|“A person whose always been such a gregarious, friendly person caused his life to be tangled in such a web, such a situation that yours has spun into. It’s so unfortunate because you had such a lovely family of such friendly people, including you. To go from that to this. Your license to practice law has been stripped away from you, you’ve turned from lawyer to witness and now you have an opportunity to make your final appeal as an ex-lawyer.|
|Murdaugh insisted: “I will tell you again. I respect this court, but I am innocent. I would never under any circumstances hurt my wife Maggie and I would never under any circumstances hurt my son paw-paw.”|
|“And it might not have been you,” Newman replied. “It might have been the monster you become when you take 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 opioid pills, and maybe you become another person. I have seen that before. The person standing before me was not the person who committed the crime, though it is the same individual. We’ll leave that at that.”|
|“I can just imagine on that day, June 7, when a lawyer is confronted and confesses to having stolen over half a million dollars from a client, and he has a tagger like Mark Tinsley on his tail pursuing discovery in the case involving the death of Mallory Beach and having a father for the most part on his deathbed. I can imagine, or I really can’t imagine, but I know that it had to be quite a bit going through your mind on that day. But amazingly to have you come and testify that it was just another ordinary day, that my wife and son and I were out just enjoying life. It is not credible. It is not believable. You can convince yourself about it, but obviously, you have the inability to convince anyone else about that.|
|“So, if you made any such arguments as a lawyer, you would lose every case like that, cases you will never have an opportunity to argue anymore, except perhaps your own as you sit in the Department of Corrections.|
|“Anything further?” the judge asked.|
|“No, sir,” Murdaugh’s lawyer replied.|
|“Mr. Murdaugh, I sentence you to the state Department of Corrections on each of the murder indictments. In the murder of your wife Maggie Murdaugh. I sentence you for the term of the rest of your natural life. For the murder of Paul Murdaugh, whom you probably loved so much, I sentence you to prison for murdering him for the rest of your natural life. Those sentences will run consecutive. Under the statute involving possession of a weapon during a violent crime there is no sentence, where a life sentence is imposed on other indictments. That is the sentence of the court and you are remanded to the state Department of Corrections. And officers may carry forth on the imposition.”|

|(WALTERBORO, S.C.) - In State v. Murdaugh, the jury found Alex Murdaugh guilty on all counts. See below for statements from Attorney General Alan Wilson and Senior Assistant Deputy Attorney General Creighton Waters:|
| *“Today’s verdict proves your position and power in life do not matter: no one is above the law, and that includes Alex Murdaugh. It’s been a long six weeks, but Maggie and Paul Murdaugh deserved justice, and they certainly did not deserve to brutally die at the hands of someone who was supposed to love and protect them. Alex Murdaugh’s house of cards, built on the foundation of lies, manipulation, and theft, came crashing down. Let this be a warning: no matter who you are, if you break the law, the truth will come out and you will be brought to justice.”* –Attorney General Alan Wilson|
| *“I want to thank the jurors for their service and the justice they delivered to Richard Alexander Murdaugh today. Alex Murdaugh tried one last con to prevent the accountability he has never had to face in his life, but the jury saw through that and properly found he murdered his wife and son in cold blood. This has been a long and exhaustive effort that could only have been achieved with the amazing team I have been fortunate to lead. Each and every one rose to the occasion, and I could not be more proud to serve with of all of them. I want to thank the entire South Carolina State Grand Jury team, SLED, our other law enforcement partners, the Clerk of Court and court security and court staff, and the entire community in Colleton County which has welcomed us and treated us so well.”* – Senior Assistant Deputy Attorney General Creighton Waters|
