| ‘Jury view’ ordered … |
| Newman’s order came in response to a request made Monday morning by Murdaugh’s lead attorney, Dick Harpootlian. According to Harpootlian, *“we believe it would be useful for the jury to visit Moselle – both the area of the kennels and the house – just to get some understanding of spatial relationships.”* “Moselle” is the local name of the Murdaugh family’s 1,700-acre hunting property – which straddles the Salkehatchie River between Hampton and Colleton counties near Islandton, S.C. *“(The jury view) needs to be done in an expeditious way,”* Harpootlian added, referencing the impending conclusion of Murdaugh’s trial which appears on track to be handed to the jury by the end of the week.|
|Murdaugh is the scion of an influential Lowcountry legal dynasty – a man who once led the Palmetto State’s powerful trial lawyers’ lobby. Today, he is in the middle of a maze of alleged criminality known as the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga. In addition to a host of other alleged crimes (many of which he confessed to on the stand last week), Murdaugh is accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on his family’s hunting property in Colleton County, S.C. on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and is currently standing trial in Walterboro – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his famous family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century. |
|Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters objected to the field trip request, saying *“the scene is different than it existed on the night of June 7, 2021.”* *“A big factor – which I think is very relevant to some of the issues here – is that the trees that were planted that separate the kennels from the house are markedly taller and thicker than they were on June 7,”* Waters added. Waters also objected to Harpootlian’s suggestion that jurors be allowed to decide for themselves whether to view the scene – saying he had *“never heard”* of a judge granting jurors such authority.|
|Newman wasted little time in granting Harpootlian’s motion. *“Upon request of either side, the court will allow a jury view,”* Newman said. *“If the defense wants a jury view, then the court will arrange a jury view.”* Newman declined to leave the matter up to the jury, though, saying a discussion of whether or not to undertake the field trip *“could invite premature deliberations in the case.”* Newman added he would advise the jury that *“as part of going to the scene, certain things may not be as they were two years ago.”* Harpootlian further requested the court ensure the scene was undisturbed at the time the jury arrived – citing recent allegations of trespassing on the property.|
| *“There were literally dozens of people at Moselle last weekend trespassing to get selfies in front of the feed room, I mean – the most distasteful kinds of things I’ve ever scene,”* Harpootlian said. *“Perhaps before they head out there some security could be (put) in place?”* *“We will have law enforcement secure the scene and ensure no one is there,”* Newman assured Harpootlian. *“The scene will be secure.”* |
|Colleton County deputies were reportedly already hard at work preparing for the field trip. Moselle is under contract to be sold as part of the disposition of Murdaugh’s assets in connection with an ongoing civil complaint. Currently, those assets are under the control of court-appointed receivers. The property is currently being managed by Murdaugh’s brother, John Marvin Murdaugh. |
| **[‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial – Defense Closes Strong](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/27/murdaugh-murders-trial-defense-closes-strong/)** |
|Alex Murdaugh’s brother provides compelling testimony … but prosecutords blast his claim of *“full cooperation”* from family.|
| A little over a week ago, the state of South Carolina rested its case against disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh in dramatic fashion. Last Friday, the state delivered an absolute evisceration of the defendant – who stands accused of murdering his wife and son in cold blood. On Monday, the defense rested … closing its case with compelling testimony from John Marvin Murdaugh, Alex Murdaugh’s youngest brother. John Marvin Murdaugh took the stand at a pivotal moment for his brother … whose decision to testify last week backfired calamitously when lead prosecutor Creighton Waters blew huge holes in his latest (and exponentially less believable) narrative of events from the night of these savage killings.|
|John Marvin Murdaugh testified in graphic detail about what he witnessed in the aftermath of the shooting, describing his brother as *“destroyed”* and *“broken.”* *“I can promise you – words don’t do it justice,”* Murdaugh said of his brother’s state of mind following the killings. *“I would have to create a new word to describe how distraught he was.”* On the day after the killings, Murdaugh said he went down to the kennels where the crime took place to see it for himself. After receiving the all-clear from law enforcement, he said he was shocked by what he witnessed upon entering the feed room. *“I saw blood, I saw brains, I saw pieces of skull,”* Murdaugh testified through sobs. *“It was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through in my life.”* Murdaugh set to work cleaning the crime scene, saying *“no mother, brother, father, uncle … no one should ever have to go through that.”* *“I couldn’t stop,”* he said. *“I had to do it for Paul. For some reason I though it was something I needed to do for Paul.”* John Marvin Murdaugh also said he made a vow to *“find out who did this to him.”* Asked at the conclusion of his testimony by his brother’s attorney, Jim Griffin, whether he believed he had found out who the ‘real killers’ were, Murdaugh responded in the negative. *“I have not,”* he testified.|
|Jurors seemed extremely engaged with Murdaugh’s brother – smiling at him, laughing at his jokes and connecting with him emotionally as he described his personal experiences responding to the tragedy which engulfed his family. But the meat of his testimony was clearly intended to call into question the integrity of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) – the agency tasked with investigating the various Murdaugh-related crimes. Among other things, John Marvin Murdaugh criticized SLED for initially refusing his offer to help locate Maggie Murdaugh’s cell phone on the afternoon after the murders. *“They say they had technology on the way,”* he said. Murdaugh later located the phone with the help of S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor Duffie Stone and investigators from his office (none of whom should have been near the scene given the fact Murdaugh was a badge-carrying assistant in Stone’s office at the time). Murdaugh also accused SLED of misleading him and other family members about the alleged presence of high-velocity impact spatter on the white shirt Murdaugh was wearing when first responders arrived following his 9-1-1 call on the evening of June 7, 2021.|
|The state attempted to keep this testimony off the record, arguing they had not introduced any such evidence at trial. Judge Clifton Newman overruled the objection and allowed John Marvin Murdaugh to continue testifying. Murdaugh was stung on cross-examination, though, as assistant attorney general John Conrad grilled him as to whether his family – and particularly his brother – provided *“full cooperation”* to investigators. This line of cross-examination reinforced the so-called “Big Lie” of this trial – in which a cell phone video recorded by Paul Murdaugh revealed his father’s presence at the scene of the murders less than five minutes before the state contends the shooting began. *“Is that full cooperation?”* Conrad asked Murdaugh about his brother lying to law enforcement about his whereabouts in the moments leading up to killings. *“I would say that yes, he lied,”* Murdaugh answered.|
|Conrad also pressed Murdaugh on his brother’s relationship with Yemassee, S.C. police chief Greg Alexander, a potentially key player in this drama whose name has been dropped on multiple occasions in the past few days of testimony. *“Were you aware chief Alexander owed your brother money?”* Conrad asked Murdaugh. *“I was not,”* he responded. In addition to our prior reporting about a “loan” Alexander received from Alex Murdaugh, prosecution witness Nathan Tuten testified earlier in the trial about cashing checks at Palmetto State Bank (PSB) and delivering envelopes full of cash to Murdaugh at his law firm office. Among the individuals Tuten says he saw in Murdaugh’s office while he was delivering these envelopes were Alexander and attorneys Cory Fleming and Chris Wilson. He says Murdaugh stopped asking him to cash checks a few weeks before the homicides.|
|With the defense resting its case, the state will have an opportunity to present rebuttal witnesses beginning on Tuesday morning. Waters indicated at least four such witnesses were likely to be called, but that a fifth was *“possible.”* After the state concludes its rebuttal testimony, jurors will take their field trip and then hear closing arguments. Once those have concluded, Newman will charge the jury with its obligations under the law and deliberations will at long last begin …|

|WALTERBORO — As John Marvin Murdaugh cleaned his nephew’s blood and brains off a feed room floor on June 8, 2021, he made a silent vow. *“In my mind, I told Paul I loved him,”* he tearfully testified to a Colleton County jury on Feb. 27. *“I promised him that I’d find out who did this to him.”* *“Have you found out?”* asked Jim Griffin, a defense attorney representing John Marvin’s brother, Alex Murdaugh. *“I have not,”* John Marvin replied. John Marvin delivered his testimony just before Alex Murdaugh’s defense team rested its case in a Lowcountry double-murder trial that has captured international attention. His account offered more evidence that Murdaugh’s relatives support and believe him as he pleads his innocence in the brutal June 2021 slayings of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul. His testimony came just days after Murdaugh, 54, admitted to lying to investigators and loved ones about his whereabouts the night of the killings.|
|Prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General’s Office say Murdaugh, a once-respected Hampton lawyer, killed his wife and son to turn himself into a victim and delay a series of inquiries that could have soon exposed his decade-long habit of stealing from his clients and law partners. But Murdaugh’s immediate family has shown no signs they buy that theory. His brothers, John Marvin and Randy Murdaugh IV; sister-in-law Liz Murdaugh; sister Lynn Murdaugh Goette and remaining son Buster Murdaugh have sat a few rows behind him nearly every day of the trial. Buster, 26, testified Feb. 21 in his father’s defense, providing context and explanations for behavior by Murdaugh that state prosecutors had held up as suspicious.
In addition to Buster, John Marvin and a pair of family friends, Murdaugh’s defense team has marched a procession of expert witnesses to the stand to poke holes in the state’s forensics evidence and discredit the investigation that led to Alex Murdaugh’s July 2022 indictment.|
|On Feb. 27, a pathologist and crime scene analyst, for example, opined that the state’s pathologist had misjudged the trajectory of the shotgun blast that killed Paul. They confidently testified Paul was shot in the back of the head, execution-style, as he stumbled forward after the first shot grazed his chest. The state’s experts had insisted Paul was shot at a dramatic upward angle as he exited a feed room by a set of dog kennels on the family’s spacious Colleton County hunting estate. They said shotgun pellets grazed Paul’s left shoulder before entering under his jaw and ejecting his brain through the back of his skull. The defense’s experts also have helped advance a theory that 52-year-old Maggie and Paul, 22, were killed by two shooters.|
|Last week, a crime scene reconstruction expert testified his bullet trajectory analysis suggests Maggie’s shooter was a foot shorter than Murdaugh, who is 6 feet, 4 inches tall. On Feb. 27, crime scene analyst Tim Palmbach, the former director of the state of Connecticut’s forensics lab, said the totality of the evidence tells him the crime was likely committed by more than one person. Palmbach noted two long guns were used in the slayings: a 12-gauge shotgun, used to kill Paul, and a .300 Blackout semiautomatic rifle, which was turned on Maggie. Palmbach testified the evidence indicates Paul was shot first. His killer likely would have been briefly stunned by the blast’s force and the shower of blood, brain and skull matter that blew back, Palmbach said. he shooter could not have quickly recovered from that impact, dropped the shotgun, picked up a rifle and *“engaged in a meaningful assault”* of Maggie, who seemed to be running toward the gunfire, Palmbach testified.|
|Prosecutors didn’t grill Palmbach about his two-shooter theory. But they have consistently brushed aside defense experts’ notions that the angle of the shots was different than what the state’s pathologist found. And they’ve mocked the idea that other shooters could have driven onto the property just minutes after Murdaugh left the kennels, found family weapons, taken Paul by surprise and slipped away undetected. While the defense’s forensic experts have worked to tear open logical holes in the state’s case, Murdaugh’s legal team has called his relatives and family friends to the witness stand to humanize the defendant. Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, Jim Griffin and Dick Harpootlian, have worked to show he was a loving husband and adoring father who couldn’t possibly have executed his wife and son. John Marvin played his part Feb. 27, appearing folksy and emotional on the witness stand. The heavy-equipment dealer sparked laughter in the courtroom as he said he was proud to be the only member of his family not to attend law school. But he choked up as he spoke of Paul, Alex’s younger son, and of his brother’s relationship with Maggie and their boys.
He recalled how Alex Murdaugh would take Buster and Paul with him any time he went hunting. *“Anything that the boys were doing, Alex wanted to do,”* John Marvin said. *“The boys always came first to him.”* Alex and Maggie Murdaugh had *“hiccups”* just like any married couple, but they loved each other, John Marvin said. He recalled a double date he and his wife had taken with them to a Darius Rucker concert. Alex and Maggie sat a row ahead of them, holding hands and swaying to the music together. *“My wife tapped me and said, ‘Why aren’t you holding my hand?’”* John Marvin said. John Marvin testified his brother was *“absolutely hysterical”* over the phone on the night of June 7, 2021, when he called to relay that Maggie and Paul had been *“hurt really badly.”* John Marvin said he could see first responders’ flashing lights when he arrived at the family’s 1,700-acre hunting property, which they called “Moselle.” He found Alex Murdaugh near the dog kennels. Maggie and Paul’s bodies lay facedown nearby. *“He was just broken, distraught. Everybody was,”* John Marvin testified. *“All we did was hug and cried. I don’t even know that we talked.”* John Marvin testified he got little sleep that night before returning to Moselle the next day. He went down to the crime scene after state investigators had finished their work there, hoping for some semblance of closure. He and Paul had grown especially close, John Marvin told jurors through tears. Paul had been working for his uncle’s Beaufort-based heavy equipment business that summer. They bonded over a shared love of hunting and the outdoors. They were both outliers in a family of high-powered lawyers. John Marvin could still see the spot on the ground where Maggie’s body had been. And he found blood, brain matter and chunks of skull in the feed room where his nephew had been shot. He testified no mother, father, aunt or uncle should ever have to see that. *“I felt like I owed him,”* John Marvin said, *“and I just started cleaning.”* |

|WALTERBORO — On the final day of testimony in Alex Murdaugh’s double-murder trial, state prosecutors and a crime scene expert worked to debunk theories Murdaugh’s defense lawyers have floated in recent weeks to blame unknown assailants for the June 2021 slayings of his wife and son. Under questioning from S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson himself, the state’s crime scene analyst described as *“preposterous”* prior testimony by the defense’s forensic experts that suggested Murdaugh’s son Paul was killed with an execution-style shotgun blast to the back of his head. Kenneth Kinsey, an Orangeburg County sheriff’s deputy, also objected to a bullet trajectory analysis concluding the shooter who killed Murdaugh’s wife, Maggie, stood no taller than 5 feet 4 inches, about a foot shorter than the defendant.
And when Kinsey was asked if the available evidence could prove the defense’s theory that Maggie and Paul were slain by two shooters, rather than one, he replied emphatically, *“Absolutely not.”* Kinsey was the last of six witnesses called by the S.C. Attorney General’s Office to testify before the trial moves on to closing arguments and jury deliberations.|
|In all, the Colleton County jury considering Murdaugh’s fate has heard from 76 witnesses — several of them multiple times. More than 60 were called to the stand by prosecutors, who have spent the past five weeks trying to prove Murdaugh, a once-respected and since-disbarred Hampton lawyer, killed his wife and son in a cold-blooded and unsuccessful ploy to cover up his financial crimes. The June 7, 2021, slayings of two members of the prominent and influential Lowcountry family generated international intrigue. The story only gained steam over the following months as Murdaugh was ousted from the law firm his great-grandfather founded in 1910, admitted a two-decade opioid addiction, tried and failed to arrange his own death and was criminally charged with stealing nearly $9 million from people who trusted him. More than 20 months after Maggie and Paul were killed, the jury will decide in the coming days if Murdaugh was responsible.|
|But first, the jury on March 1 will travel to the crime scene, a set of dog kennels on the Murdaughs’ nearly 1,800-acre hunting property in Islandton, 30 minutes from the courthouse where they have gathered for the last six weeks. Judge Clifton Newman ordered the trip at the defense’s request and over the objection of prosecutors who said it would be potentially misleading because the scene has changed since 2021. After that, prosecutors and Murdaugh’s defense team will square off in closing arguments before the jury begins deliberating.|
|The last testimony jurors heard came from witnesses called by the state to rebut points raised in the past week by Murdaugh’s defense team. Murdaugh’s attorneys at various points in the trial have offered the possibility that Maggie and Paul were killed by two shooters. On Feb. 27, one of the defense’s crime scene experts testified he thought this scenario was likely, especially given both victims were killed with different long guns — a shotgun and an military-style rifle. The defense’s experts also have focused on the trajectories of the shots that killed Maggie and Paul, alleging the 6-foot-4 Murdaugh was too tall to have inflicted the wounds found on both victims.|
|Kinsey, a 30-year veteran of law enforcement who presented as both personable and witty, almost laughed off those theories. *“I think his intentions were well,”* Kinsey said of one defense expert, *“but I think his methods were flawed.”* Kinsey said the defense’s crime scene analysts were far too confident in their conclusions. He testified they also relied on assumptions that can’t be vetted, including the position and movement of the shooter as well as the way in which the still-missing rifle that killed Maggie ejects spent shell casings. Maggie’s killer could have been 7 feet 4 inches tall, for instance, depending on how they oriented their body, Kinsey said. The shooter could have crouched or pulled the trigger from their knees, Kinsey supposed.|
| *“The shooter is running around, and so is the victim,”* Wilson asserted, highlighting the difficulty of reconstructing a crime scene with certainty. *“It’s chaotic. It’s crazy. … There’s no way to know how the gun is being held, shouldered, angled.”* Kinsey agreed.|
|The state called several other witnesses to the stand Feb. 28, including a pair of former law partners who helped prosecutors paint Murdaugh as a master manipulator who lied easily and often to get what he wanted. Their testimony came after Murdaugh himself took the witness stand for two days last week, tearfully and forcefully insisting he did not kill his wife and son and could never have hurt them.|
|Parker Law Group attorney Ronnie Crosby described his former law partner on Feb. 28 as a *“theatrical-type presence in the courtroom.”* *“He could get very emotional doing closing arguments in front of a jury,”* Crosby said. In a tense exchange, Murdaugh defense attorney Dick Harpootlian tried to establish that Crosby testified out of anger for Murdaugh, whose thefts from legal clients left the law firm borrowing millions of dollars to pay them back. Crosby insisted he wasn’t still angry with Murdaugh. He used to be, particularly in fall 2021, but realized he needed to *“move on with life.”* He said he took issue with Harpootlian implying he’d lie on the witness stand out of spite. *“Even though it has cost your firm, and it’s cost millions of dollars to you, you’ve forgiven him?”* Harpootlian asked. *“I didn’t say I forgave him,”* Crosby retorted. *“I said I had no feelings. I’ve had to work on that.”* Harpootlian glanced over at the jury. He said it would be up to them to decide.|

| WALTERBORO — Disgraced former attorney Alex Murdaugh is a gifted liar who spent a decade concealing his true identity as a white-collar thief and opioid addict, prosecutor Creighton Waters told a Colleton County jury. In his closing argument on March 1, Waters reminded jurors that Murdaugh had deceived his family, his closest friends, his law partners and his legal clients — from whom he stole millions of dollars. Waters alleged the ex-Hampton lawyer’s web of lies led directly to the June 2021 slayings of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul — a pair of grisly killings that prosecutors say served as Murdaugh’s last-ditch effort to turn himself into a victim and buy time to cover up his soon-to-be-exposed thefts.|
|*“He’s fooled them all, and he fooled Maggie and Paul,”* Waters told the jury. *“And they paid for it with their lives. Don’t let him fool you, too.”* Waters ended his three-hour closing argument moments later by asking the jury to return a guilty verdict for Murdaugh in the murders of his wife and son. The state’s lead prosecutor asked jurors to vindicate Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, who *“need a voice because they can no longer speak.”* |
|Waters delivered his closing argument mid-way through the sixth week of a Walterboro double-murder trial that has attracted international attention. His presentation began shortly after jurors returned from a field trip to the crime scene — a set of dog kennels and sheds on the nearly 1,800-acre Colleton County hunting estate the prominent Murdaugh family called home. Throughout Waters’ closing argument, Murdaugh seemed to take on the affectation of an opposing attorney, scribbling notes in some moments and watching the prosecutor intently in others. |
|Murdaugh rarely evinced emotion, even as Waters repeatedly labeled him a liar and a killer. Murdaugh’s surviving son, Buster, brother John Marvin and sister Lynn also remained largely stoic as they watched from their seats in the courtroom. Murdaugh attorney Jim Griffin is expected to deliver the defense’s argument to the jury first thing March 2. Prosecutors will then have an opportunity to respond. Following that, the jury will be tasked with determining Murdaugh’s culpability for the grisly slayings.|
|Griffin said he expects his closing argument to last two hours. He will have plenty of ground to cover after Waters’ extensive presentation March 1.|
|Waters meticulously walked jurors through the greatest hits of the state’s case — from the financial crimes prosecutors believe motivated the killings to the minute-by-minute timeline investigators assembled from cellphone data. And he asked jurors to use their common sense to put the pieces together. That includes a timeline of digital evidence and a video on Paul’s cellphone that places Murdaugh at the scene of the crime with the victims just minutes before they abruptly stopped responding to text messages and phone calls. It also includes videos of three interviews in which Murdaugh repeatedly lied to investigators about being there.|
| *“Why would he lie about that, ladies and gentlemen?”* Waters asked. *“Why would he even think to lie about that if he was an innocent man?”* Waters also highlighted testimony that Maggie was killed with a family rifle that Murdaugh can’t account for. He noted investigators couldn’t rule out the possibility that Paul was shot with a family shotgun. Bullet casings found near Maggie’s body matched older casings found elsewhere on the Murdaugh’s hunting property and likely came from Paul’s missing .300 Blackout semiautomatic rifle, Waters said.|
| *“The defendant had the means to commit these crimes,”* Waters said. Waters noted neither Maggie nor Paul had defensive wounds, indicating they didn’t perceive their shooter as a threat. *“Why? Because it’s him,”* Waters said of Murdaugh. Waters accused Murdaugh of drawing on his experience as a lawyer and part-time prosecutor in the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office to mislead the state’s murder investigation and construct an alibi as he went. He contended that Murdaugh used two long guns to seed a theory that two people were involved, then disposed of them somewhere they haven’t been found, ditched Maggie’s phone down the road and got rid of the clothes he was wearing that evening. Waters also accused Murdaugh of making a flurry of phone calls and briefly visiting his ailing mother to create a cover story.|
| *“He’s smart. He’s a good lawyer. His family has a history of prosecution. He understands these issues,”* Waters said. *“He knows what to do to prevent evidence from being gathered.”*
Waters urged jurors not to believe what they heard when Murdaugh testified in his own defense last week. Murdaugh admitted to lying to investigators out of paranoia about becoming a suspect, but he forcefully denied hurting his wife and son.|
|For the first time since the killings, Murdaugh acknowledged that day from the witness stand that he went down to see Maggie and Paul at the dog kennels. But he insisted he returned back to the Moselle residence a few minutes later. *“I got out of there,”* Murdaugh said on the witness stand. Waters seized on that language during his closing argument, asking jurors if that sounds like a guiltless father.|
| *“He didn’t say: ‘If only I had been there. … If only I could have stopped it. If only I could have been there a little longer,’”* Waters said. *“He says, ‘I got out of there.’”* |
|Waters prepared jurors to hear in Griffin’s rebuttal that the state’s theory of the case is too bizarre to believe. Waters said if the state’s theory is hard to relate to, it’s because the Murdaugh saga is unlike any other — the violent unraveling of a man living a double life as a prosperous lawyer and a desperate con man.|
| *“He is a different man than the kind of stories you’ve seen before,”* Waters said. >“This is a different set of circumstances than you’ve seen before.”* Before wrapping up his argument, Waters showed the jury one last exhibit: a crime scene photo of the carnage the killer inflicted.  *“This is what he did,”* Waters said. *“This is what he did right here.”* |
|Earlier in the day, the jury spent more than an hour touring Moselle, the Murdaughs’ spacious hunting property on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties. The rural property, located in Islandton, has been essentially off-limits to the public since the June 2021 slayings. It also is under contract to be sold, with the proceeds to be split among Murdaugh’s relatives and his alleged financial victims, according to a legal settlement reached weeks ago. Jurors stayed at Moselle for about an hour and 15 minutes. They could be seen walking through the dog kennels and a shed, which was the location where Maggie and Paul were killed. One juror stood in the feed room doorway for a closer look at the spot where Paul was standing when a gunman turned a 12-gauge shotgun on him. The jury also viewed the outside of the property’s main house, and they pulled onto the sparse country road it sits on to walk to the family’s shooting range across the street.|
|Jurors and lawyers were escorted around the property by some of the key law enforcement witnesses who have testified before them. That included Daniel Greene, a sergeant with the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office. He was the first to arrive at the crime scene on the night of the slayings. Jurors were not allowed to speak with each other or ask questions of anyone other than Judge Clifton Newman. It also included Detective Laura Rutland, who interviewed Murdaugh on the night of the killings, and Capt. Jason Chapman, who supervised the crime scene until state investigators arrived. Jurors saw a sprawling property that has changed considerably since that time.|
|For most of the past year, no one regularly cared for the property as Murdaugh languished without bond in jail. Jurors saw tall grass and overgrown shrubs as they toured the property. The black mailbox at the driveway by the dog kennels was covered in pollen and spiderwebs. A “no trespassing” sign was tied to a post at the top of the mailbox. Lights atop the property’s ornamental brick entrance sat askew.
 rosecutors had also been careful to mention that a set of young pine trees planted between the house and kennels has had 20 months to grow since the slayings. They worried the trip might lead jurors to wrongfully conclude it would be difficult to see the kennels from the main residence nearly 400 yards away, and vice versa. But Murdaugh’s defense attorneys pushed for the field trip. They said it would help jurors get a lay of the land and see for themselves a place they have heard described at length for nearly six weeks.|

|Prosecutor Creighton Waters lowers the boom on Alex Murdaugh …|
|Disbarred South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh had the motive, means and opportunity to murder his wife and younger son on the family’s hunting property near Islandton, S.C. twenty-one months ago, according to lead prosecutor Creighton Waters. Not only that, his lies and guilty actions in the aftermath of the murders – combined with the sheer implausibility of any other rational scenarios for the carnage – demand guilty verdicts on all counts, Waters told jurors.|
| *“We couldn’t bring you any eyewitnesses – because they were murdered,”* Waters said.|
|Murdaugh is accused of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and for the last six weeks has been standing trial in Walterboro – part of the Lowcountry region of the Palmetto State which his famous family ruled like a fiefdom for more than a century. The scion of an influential Lowcountry legal dynasty, Murdaugh once led the Palmetto State’s powerful trial lawyers’ lobby. Today, he is at the epicenter of a maze of alleged criminality known as the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|Ironically? It was Murdaugh’s own testimony which could play a pivotal role in sealing his fate.|
|In a closing argument which channeled his decisive cross-examination of Murdaugh less than a week ago, Waters walked jurors through Murdaugh’s “big lie” -a.k.a. his presence at the scene of the killings less than five minutes before they took place. |
|Jurors – who got a first-hand look at the crime scene on Wednesday morning – were also walked through how Murdaugh lied to them repeatedly on the witness stand last week. According to Waters, the defendant concocted a new story *“on the fly”* as he testified about his alleged reasons for deceiving investigators during an interview in the early morning hours of June 8, 2021.|
|Murdaugh testified it was his distrust of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED), opioid pills in his pockets and questions about his familial relationships from SLED investigator David Owen which caused him to experience paranoia – which in turn prompted him to lie. In fact, under questioning from Waters he identified the precise moment in the interview when he purportedly decided to deceive investigators.|
|Unfortunately for Murdaugh, he appears to have forgotten that he told the same lie on both the 9-1-1 call to dispatchers – and to sergeant Daniel Greene of the Colleton County sheriff’s office.|
| *“He was lying to you when he made those up,”* Waters said. *“Just like he’s lied to everyone who is close to him.”* |
| *“He’s good,”* Waters said. “He’s good.”* According to Waters, Murdaugh *“lies convincingly – and can do it at the drop of a hat.”* Through Murdaugh’s maze of misinformation, Waters identified three things he said on the stand that had a ring of truth to them – that the killer of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh *“thought about it for a very long time,”* *“had hate in his heart”* and *“hurt the ones he loved the most.”* |
| *“He says things in one context and means them in another,”* Waters said.|
|Waters also pointed out to jurors Murdaugh’s habit of nodding when he is lying. *“Is that the most classic tell ever?”* he asked. *“I’ll leave that to you to decide.”* |
|As Waters delivered his closing, Murdaugh scanned the jury seeking to make eye contact with its members. Finding few takers, he opted to stare straight ahead – occasionally leaning over to one of his attorneys to confer. Waters’ closing argument had a bit of everything: A broad overview of Murdaugh’s financial crimes (and their imminent exposure), a detailed recapitulation of SLED’s timeline for the murders and – as mentioned – an exhaustive inventory of the many occasions when Murdaugh’s version of events ran counter to reality. Invariably, Waters said, such divergence took place when the defendant was *“confronted with facts he could no longer deny.”*|
|‘One thing I will agree with him is when he said, ‘oh what a tangled web we weave,'” Waters said, recalling Murdaugh’s invocation of the famous quote from Sir Walter Scott last Thursday. *“How appropriate is that.”*  |
|Every bit as effective as his flaying of Murdaugh was Waters’ mockery of assertions made by defense experts. Chief among them? The notion that the individual(s) who murdered Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were both diminutive in stature – and part of a completely static crime scene.|
| *“These vigilantes that are 5-foot-2 knew Paul and Maggie would be at Moselle, knew that they would be alone, knew the property well enough to get to the kennels – and assumed they would find ammunition and guns there,”* Waters said.|
| *“These vigilantes were just lucky enough to find these family weapons there,”* he said, noting they arrived at the kennels at the precise moment Murdaugh claims to have departed – without alerting any of the dogs roaming the property.|
|Waters concluded his closing with a passionate plea on behalf of the two victims – urging jurors to use their *“common sense and human nature”* as they prepare to begin their deliberations.|
| *“Maggie and Paul deserve a voice,”* he said. *“They need a voice because they can no longer speak. The system depends on those who take that oath as jurors – who make that tough decision to vindicate these victims. To vindicate Maggie and Paul – who were cut down in the prime of their lives.”* |
|As he spoke, Waters pulled up one of the graphic sealed exhibits depicting the sheer savagery of the slayings. |
| *“This is what he did,”* Waters said, pointing to Murdaugh. J“He fooled Maggie and Paul – and they paid for it with their lives,”* Waters concluded. *“Don’t let him fool you.”* |
|Murdaugh attorney Jim Griffin is scheduled to deliver the closing argument for the defense tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. EST. After he has finished, assistant attorney general John Meadors is expected to provide a rebuttal from the state. Once Meadors has concluded his remarks, judge Clifton Newman will instruct the jury as to its duties under the law. At that point, Murdaugh’s fate will rest in the hands of the twelve Colleton County chosen back on January 25, 2023.|
